50,"Cucuruchos is a great place to spend your time in Antigua. It serves a laid-back, relaxing base to explore Antigua and its surroundings. It's very clean with the best internet connection I have experienced in Central America. Jimena and Dario do a great job at making everyone feel at ease and the free coffee, cake, computer availability, cold-weather clothes are just a grasp of all they have to offer to their guests. Greatly recommended!",POS
30,"We booked this place through Booking for one night. We stayed longer in Antigua but left this place after one night. We arrived after a bumpy ride from San Pedro Atitlan and didn't feel very welcome. The women wasn't really friendly and she appointed us the most shabby bathroom. As they are all shared and prices equal, I don't really see why we should use one or another. When asking for information it was quite clear that she wasn't really good informed (which I can even understand) but what bothered me more is that she seemed annoyed with us asking for information. The room and bathrooms are quite clean though the room is a bit damp. The room was 200 Qt a night and we didn't really feel like this was good value for money.",NEG
30,"An odd mix of positives and negatives : +ves hot water, central location and helpful staff. -ves: noisy, having to wash and brush teeth at basins in common area. Room had no window. More hostel than hotel. This place suits more young people who don't mind guests coming in at all hours of the night, but if you value six hours plus of sleep, maybe this is not the place for you. My room, with no window, had a vent grill fixed into the door which meant that the music they place from 8am to 10pm all day comes booming into your room. I am 55...maybe if I was 22 again I wouldn't mind! But the staff are lovely and friendly and the location is VERY central. Swings and roundabouts on this one I think.",NEG
30,We had been recommended this hostel because of its terrace (bar/restaurant) which really is great - an amazing view of the volcano and nice and sunny. The private room we were in was tiny! But nice to have a bathroom v near the room. What let down the hostel for us was the kitchen on the terrace playing loud music from 7.30am. The private rooms are just beneath it so we all woke up straight away. It was a shame because the night before we had come back from a meal at around ten thirty to find the bar/terrace empty and closed! We would have much preferred the music then. The staff were friendly and it's a good location.,NEG
20,"I knew this place is right underneath the Sky Bar, and I knew it would be a bit noisy, but I wasn't prepared for HOW noisy. According to the hostel, ""quiet time"" is from 10pm, when the doors are closed to keep out the noise from the restaurant. So I was hopeful to at least get a few hours of sleep before catching the 4am shuttle to Honduras... But there was absolutely no chance of sleeping before 2am due to the noise. The room I stayed in didn't have a window, just some mosquito mesh screen, so even when the restaurant noise (screaming people, music, tables being dragged across the floor and so on... even ear plugs didn't help) stopped at about midnight, I was kept awake by the noise from the hostel staff and other guests talking loudly. I can't blame them for that, obviously! I",NEG

50,The hotel is BEAUTIFUL and the staff is amazing and nice. Porta is Definitely a place to stay when in antigua.

50,I come here twice a year all the way from Europe and it feels like coming home to family and friends. The staff and the owners are exceprional and they do absolutely everything to please their guests and make them feel at home.

Book well in advance though as the 8 rooms fill up quickly of course.,POS

40,"Mil Flores is a small boutique hotel that consists of six suites that  vary in size and decor.  It could be considered as bed and breakfast as the property  is a restored Spanish colonial era property located right off the cobblestone street with a very unassuming entrance.  A  great balance of old world Antigua and modern design, we stayed in the Jacaranda Suite which was just beautiful as was the courtyard with the lap pool and hot tub.  The staff was very  friendly, attentive and available 24/7 which made for a very personable experience.  Centrally located the hotel is secured and accessible to guests only and requires that the staff unlock the wrought iron gate for any type of access, which we felt was appropriate for this type of property.  Definitely a place to recommend.",POS
50,"This is a lovely boutique style hotel located just a few steps away from the main square in Antigua. The service was friendly and faultless. The room was characterful and very comfortable and clean - perhaps a little dark as no natural light but this is the style of the hotel. We stayed here for 4 nights in all taking time away from Antigua to go on various day and overnight trips and leaving our main bags in the safety of the hotel until we got back. The staff were so accommodating, happily looking after our luggage and moving it back into our room ready for our return. The hotel was very safe, the front gate is kept locked at all times so people cannot just wander in off of the street.  There is a lovely roof terrace where breakfast is served. You can lay in the sun or indulge",POS
30,"If I remember correctly, this place had the prestigious ""Our Pick"" in the new Lonely Planet guide, which gave me too many expectations. It is a decent hostel, with an EXCEPTIONALLY GREAT breakfast, but the dorm room was a bit dirty and the beds weren't that great and I didn't love the showers. I mean it's a good place but expect a regular hostel, not an ""our pick"" type hostel. I also stayed at Hostal Antigua, and I honestly liked that place better.",NEG

You get an amazing view of Volcán de Agua and the busy streets of Antigua are right outside. The hotel features an impressive courtyard with a fountain. Extremely good experience and hope to visit again.",POS
50,"Stayed here 6 nights while on business in Guatemala.    The hotel was fantastic at night and even better in the daylight.   Every walkway, every turn of the corner looked like it was out of a designer magazine.  Antique pieces accentuate the décor so you can stop and contemplate days gone by. Water features provide a soothing and relaxing background as you walk around.  My room, a double queen with a small sitting area was comfortable and quiet. But task lighting could have been a little better. Bedding and linens were absolutely first class and may have been the best at any hotel I've stayed at.  The bathroom had a cupola, that during the day emitted a soothing, soft, and natural light in the space. Towels were large and thirsty.  Robes too if you like that kind of detail. ",POS
50,"We spent several nights at this picturesque inn....great location, nice rooms and bath, safe and secure, close to wonderful bakery and good restaurants (though we appreciated the nearby Domino's Pizza that delivered to our room on two nights of torrential rainstorms).

40,"Beautiful place, great location a few blocks from Parque Central, Santo Domingo, and Las Capuchinas. Nice sized room, huge king sized bed, adequate bathroom with no water temperature or pressure issues. The grounds are gorgeous and well kept. Daily breakfast is fine if you mix it up a bit between the Desayuno Americano and the Chapina. There are three great bars on the street (Cafe No Se, La Biblioteca, and Cafe Sky) and some excellent eateries (Angie Angie, Y Tu Pina Tambien) and if you are a night owl you can party close to home.

50,"My husband and I had the absolute best stay here.   The Grounds: The hotel grounds are absolutely gorgeous. There are lush plants and flowers everywhere. The pool is small but it is no ordinary hotel pool; it's in the open-air common area of the ground floor, and is surrounded by vines and feels like a part of a luxurious garden. There is a cozy living room common space. Our booking came with breakfast, which we ate on the beautiful, lush rooftop each day. Even if it rains the night before, the staff go up early to the roof to dry things off and put out dry cushions so that guests can enjoy it every morning. There's also a dining room to eat indoors but I never used it since eating on the roof was so gorgeous!  The Room: We stayed in the suite at the end of the hall. It was one",POS

Our room although only a standard room is very large with antique furniture and a very luxurious bathroom with separate bath and shower, well lit with both chandelier and special make-up lights around the large mirror----really one of the nicest bathrooms ever!  Our room is on the side, not overlooking the main street, so it's very quiet.  There's a wide veranda on the second storey with comfortable settees and lamps for reading, over looking the lovely interior garden.  The staff have been charming and very helpful.

Close to restaurants and attractions.  Unfortunately , our rooms which were very spacious and comfortable, looked nothing like those pictured online.  I realize that was because a member of our party needed wheelchair access for both the room and the bathroom. The staff were always very helpful in assisting him when needed and  we looked forward to returning for our last night.

40,"Stayed at Hostal Antigua for 3 nights after negotiating a good rate in a 4 bed dorm which was practically empty throughout my stay. Location is in the heart of the town and right next to plenty of restaurants and good night life. WiFi worked well and rooms were cleaned often. Cable TV in rooms too :)  All in all, it's worth staying here if you want somewhere a little bit on the quiet side as there aren't any real communal areas to meet other travellers.",POS
50,"After considerable research, I settled on this hostel as my first choice, and for the duration of my stay it exceeded my expectations. Bigfoot's staff and volunteer staff were exceptional in making me feel welcome. I was graciously allowed to check in earlier than typical, after arriving in Antigua in the early hours. This hostel is just south of the landmark church ruins the Society of Jesus, and one block west of Antigua's central park. Everything worth exploring is within 5-10 minutes walk (except Café No Sé for tasty mescal and Coffeeshop San Simon for the best cocktails and flair bartending in all Guatemala! That takes maybe 15 minutes Ծ_Ծ ). The kitchen has some of the best food in Antigua, and in comparison to other food options in town is worth the extra dollar or two.",POS
50,I toiled with the idea of writing a review purely on account of wanting to keep Sor Juana a secret but that would seem unfair to other travellers. I also wanted to exhaust the professionalism of Julio and Jimmena who were helpful from booking to paying attention to our every need during our five day stay. I felt looked after in a very positive way. Sor Juana does Antigua proud. The hotel has character and a deep sense of history within its walls. It has been thoughtfully decorated to a high standard and is both comfortable and enchanting. Other reviewers oh this site have felt the rooms lacked light. Personally I don't see this as a problem. Breakfast was served on a splendid roof terrace with amazing views to the surrounding volcanoes. The coffee flowed without prompting.,POS

The rooms are clean and just spacious enough (but don't expect an enormous room, though). Wifi is fast and reliable throughout the hostel. One of the biggest benefits of staying here is the amazing breakfast served every day. Location of the hostel is good and central. Maybe the only negative point is that there are few bathrooms and the are located downstairs (inconvenient when staying upstairs).   If you are planning to hike the Acatenango, book through the hostel with Soy Tours, amazing experience!",POS

After checking several hotels that were recommended but were fully booked we arrived at Hotel la Casa de don Ismael, a small place hidden at the end of an alley. But they had room for us. The lobby was dark but there were live candles burning everywhere. Our room # 2, on the second floor, was not terribly interesting but it could sleep three and had a separate bathroom.

The breakfasts next door at Fernando's were delicious (except the egg dish on the buffet on Sunday morning..rather bland).  I'd gladly return to Posada La Merced.",POS

Very secure. The rooms and hallways are SUPER clean, literally squeeky clean. Showers are HOT. Above all, the staff and owner go above and beyond to help. Rosario help me set up rides to and from neighboring cities, and wound up stepping in to fix a booking mistake I made that would have left me stranded. Again, really great, quiet place. Would recommend to anyone.",POS

We felt very safe, & as others have said, the location could not have been more convenient.  A swimming pool is available for patrons use at nearby hotel for a fee of $5 per person.  Our only problems?  1-We had trouble getting hot water from the shower, & the staff responded immediately when we brought it to their attention.  The water was then tolerably warm, though not hot.  2- If you're staying on a Saturday night, bring",POS

I could not be any happier with the choice and if you are on the fence whether to book it, I would highly recommend it.   First, the hotel is a beautifully restored baroque mansion with amazing lush tropical garden and a terrace with flowers and some of the best views in Antigua - towards all three volcanoes surrounding the city. Great for photo ops. The rooms and bathrooms are super spacious and with unique antique furnishings.

Our room was clean and comfortable, though a bit dark. The staff was very helpful (we needed help arranging  transportation to Lake Atitlan and the airport), and even put up with my mother's telephoned-in request, on New Year's Eve, to make a little ""Happy New Year"" sign and bring it to our room (that was really above and beyond the call of duty!). Breakfast is not included, but for $5 per person, it was really quite good. The location is fabulous, just a short walk to the Merced and the main square. The only drawback is that there is really no sound insulation--noise from the street is not bad, but you can pretty",POS

The morning coffee and pastries and all day tea making facilities are great and we felt totally relaxed and well looked after. We stayed in the ground floor room facing the street and weren't bothered by noise but we were given earplugs just in case.

I originally tried booking an extra night before the group tour, but only received an auto reply, never an answer to my question regarding an extra night. Bad customer service, but I am happy I stayed somewhere else that night, considering the standard of the hotel.   The first room we got (room 208 I believe) was horrible really warm/damp with mold everywhere: In the shower, on the mirror and even at the toilet seat. The rooms have no AC, no safe, and no fan unless you ask for it. After checking with the group leader we found out that not all rooms where as bad as ours, and got to move to room 203 (I believe), which was a lot better.

I had seen the Earthlodge in the Moon guidebook to Guatemala and it sounded interesting so I looked them up online and reserved the Deluxe Tree Cabin for a Friday and Saturday night. We spent our first two nights in Antigua and then took a shuttle, arranged through Earthlodge, up the hill with a group of pre-med students who were also staying there. It is a bit isolated but that is part of the charm of the place. We found the tree cabin to be very clean and comfortable.

The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are spacious and impeccably clean, and the staff and courteous and helpful. The only minor quibbles we had are that a) the pool available for hotel guests is at nearby Hotel El Portal (about 5 minute walk away) rather than on-site, and b) the food at the hotel was below standard, small portions, and expensive. Other than that, the hotel has some stunning views of the volcano and is a tranquil oasis in the middle of lovely Antigua. Would recommend a stay. ",POS

We had the roof top room with private bath and its own small, charming garden from which both the cathedral La Merced and Volcán Agua are visible.

The front dorm is a little noisy at night due to proximity to the street but not seriously so.The roof terrace is a lovely place to hang out, watch the world go by, meet other travellers and check out the volcanoes.

Their beautiful layout, lush landscaping and traditional decor add up to all the hype.  But why oh why do this and other hotels insist on charging for internet. In this day and age Internet access is not a luxury but a basic service. This glitch is small but I hope they take notice.

It truly gives you the feel that you are in Antigua.  It could be a little noisy being that most of the rooms face the courtyard and you can hear the street.  The Arch does have bells that go off every hour so you can hear that.  Besides a little bit of the noise the place was perfect.,POS

The rooms are comfortable, clean and the hotel grounds are gorgeous and immaculately maintained. The staff are very friendly and helpful (thanks Teresa and Joseph!!) and the restaurant is excellent.

The rooms have hot water and were fine.  One thing we didn't like was the way the toilet doors left a little gap, we solved this problem by hanging a towel over the door.",NEG
40,"The rooms are certainly more than adequate. We had 2 full beds and they were very comfortable. One added element was the air conditioning, welcome after lots of walking in Antigua.

The beds and baths are adequate though I wish they'd put additional blankets on the bed when the weather turns cooler. That said, we arrived on a Saturday night and the noise level coming from the bar/establishment next door, was incredible! Fortunately, my kids and I are very sound sleepers and we were exhausted so we managed, after sometime, to get to sleep. The situation was identical on Sunday night. It wasn't until Monday that it quieted down.  The hotel charges more on the weekend because of the increase in demand from the city. I suggest they offer a discount instead. The noise level is really a disservice to its guests.",NEG

Antigua is an atmospheric tourist town where hoteliers appear to compete qualitatively. There are a lot of attractive superior properties in the $50-100 per night range. If paying more, I hope you get something truly special because there's a lot of quality in the mid-range properties and some super value among lesser priced hostels. After a week home stay in language school at San Pedro on Lake Atitlan, Casa Antigua was very inviting (my teens endorsed the place).

Their focus as best as we can tell is on their restaurant guests and certainly not their hotel guests. I cannot recommend staying here - would actually recommend avoiding it. If we could have checked out early we would have.  We booked the Grand Suite and here are the issues:  - On their website the Grand Suite states ""to the right of the entrance doors there is a small private winding staircase to the third floor terrace."" which we thought meant it was private to us...well its private to anyone that wants to use it, which were numerous individuals. Because it is a metal spiral staircase it is very noisy in the Grand Suite when it is being used. - Our mistake we thought",NEG

We looked at so many hotels either to expensive or so cheap (Hostels) with out towels, soap, etc. Casa Cristina had what we were looking for; private bathroom, clean rooms and free internert.  I miss having my morning coffee on the terrace over looking the Merced Church and the many  Volcanoes. ",POS

Our room had a nice Queen bed and a Jacuzzi! We loved the Jacuzzi, it was so relaxing and added a special touch to our stay. The bed sheets, the towels, everything was nice and clean. I would say the only drawbacks would be that the parking lot was around the corner and we had to walk a little bit—luckily it seemed safe. The colonial windows are gorgeous but the curtains don't quite cover the windows well when there is wind, so if you need more privacy you may want to really make sure you have the curtains closed well, as other guests could take a peek into your room.

For your understanding - there are around 12 rooms in the whole hotel. We were staying in Junior suite. Overall, the room was decorated so wonderful, that we had a feeling that we want to take home every second piece of furniture. There was even a real fireplace! The only thing about the room which did not exceed our expectations was view - we were looking at green hedge.  Regarding food: we had exceptional dinner at hotel's restaurant (even though it was quite expensive). Breakfast disappointed us a bit: there was tasty juice and cappuccino, but choice of food was very limited (eggs,",POS

Not the cheapest in Antigua at 200q for the room. The bottom floor is pretty cool with a ping pong table, kitchen and lounge area. Gives it a very homely feel. Lady who checked us in was very nice and we had booked the overnight volcano trek and left a 300q deposit each. However the next day i hadto be hospitalised and they refused to refund the deposit saying we needed to give 24 hours notice (which was not stated anywhere).

Our first two nights we stayed in a room that had windows facing the street and it was a little noisy at night. After we came back from an overnight trip to Tikal, we moved into a different room on the opposite end of the hotel for a little more quiet. The staff were friendly and accommodating - they were happy to hold on to some of our bulky luggage while we were gone for the Tikal excursion and greeted us with a smile when we returned.

Smaller rooms with less people are better but more expensive and its on a first come first serve basis.  I did sleep in the large six person room for a few nights and it worked perfectly fine.  The hostel is secure to outsiders so you can feel safe.  The breakfasts are absolutely awesome!  Upstairs are areas to sit, chat, play cards and meet people.  The staff is also very helpful and help book any of your travel needs.  I have heard horror stories about other hostels so any time I go to Antigua, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Yellow House.",POS

Priced at 100Q for a private room with wifi this seems decent value, however the rooms are incredibly basic, unclean with mosquitos everywhere and insects over the floor and in the bathroom. There was no key for the door apparently, however it did lock from the inside, although it did not feel a very secure place to stay other than having a night guard and big front door which is locked throughout the night.

The room has a large plasma tv with a ton of channels in English. There is a great walk-in closet. Best of all, there is a 2 person jacuzzi in the bathroom! -great after doing the volcano hike.  We were served breakfast in our room most days, except for one when we asked to go on the terrace. They serve you eggs, fruit, coffee, pancakes, ham, cheese, bread and cereal. Plenty of food.  There is wifi too, though it gets a bit spotty - probably because of the thick walls. The hotel is very quiet, and very convenient",POS

Amazing food, beautiful grounds, astounding views with a competent friendly staff made us feel very welcome.  We winged this whole trip and were lucky enough to hear of earth lodge. They had no opening on Christmas but they were willing to pitch us a tent. I don't think that's standard operating procedure but the fact is they were gonna do it to keep us from being homeless on Christmas. We got lucky and had a last minute opening for one of the established tents. Very grateful. Some people complain dinner is at seven and family style but we enjoyed the change of pace and the opportunity to talk to fellow travelers. Not the cheapest place we've stayed on",POS

The second we get to the property she had her mind made up already that she was not going to have a good time. The moment we got here she started yelling at the staff like they were wild animals and ended her stay getting drunk and yelling at the staff because the kitchen was closed.   The property is situated on the side of the mountain overlooking the volcanoes and the city of Antigua. The view and vibe is incredible and tranquil. This is not a party hostel but more so somewhere to go and enjoy what nature has to offer. Earth lodge is about self sustainability and prides them self on this.

The spa was amazing and I convinced my family to all get massages which they stated were one of the best they ever had.

Breakfast on the beautifully landscaped roof terrace was delicious and served with great charm by Augustine. Tea, coffee and small cakes were available in the lounge 24 hours a day. We really appreciated this.   Our room (no 1) was small, quiet, comfortable and very well equipped but we would have liked a bit more shelf space for our belongings.

We utilized the Celiba Spa and had a wonderful experience.  We had an exfoliation, the mud wrap, and a couples massage for our anniversary, and the therapists were wonderful.  I would recommend taking advantage of the spa.   We had a decent buffet breakfast in the morning with typical Guatemalan dishes along with an egg station before we left for our next hotel.

Also, the food is incredible. I hardly leave to eat at other places when I am there. They just started making the most delicious cheese platters that are to die for.

Parking is at a lot about 2 blocks away, or between 3-5 minutes depending on how fast you walk. You could take a Tuk-Tuk but that seems like more effort than is needed. You can pull up on side of the hotel (the street in front is blocked to vehicular traffic from 7 am to 10 pm or so) and someone from the hotel will get your bags and then you can head to the parking lot.

The rooftop terrace was where I spent my first and last night in Guatemala and I couldn't have enjoyed myself more.  Brent, Shelby, Bekki and all the staff were friendly and more than helpful.

It is on a quiet residential street just 4 blocks from the central plaza. Although the building appears to be centuries old, I believe it was constructed less than 40 years ago.  This results in an artful synthesis of classic charm and modern conveniences such as plumbng and electricity.  We were there during Holy Week, and the price was $140/night.

It feels a little like a dungeon down in there and the windows of your room open right onto the patio/lobby/breakfast area, so you feel kind of exposed.

The hotel seemed to me appealing to persons travelling with their family (an access to a fridge and a small kitchen being conveniently provided),  or to couples looking for a romantic setting, as well as people like me on business trips.

Rooms are good too.

There are so many intimate spaces to read, relax or meditate in the hotel.  The courtyards are beautiful and the gentle sound of the water adds to the ambience.  After a long day of walking the facinating cobbled stone streets of Antigua, it was alwasy a treat to return and relax on the comfortable couches and enjoy the courtyard.  On our walks through the city, we passed many hotels and peaked into the courtyards.  Meson de Maria was definately my favourite and when I return to Antigua, I will definately be staying there again.  Hopefully next time, it will be for longer.",POS

First, the good stuff.  As is the case for many places in Antigua, from the outside, it is hard to tell what is behind the high walls of the hotel.  Once you get inside, you find a very clean place with friendly and helpful staff.  The grounds are beautiful.  There are many paths to wander and it is easy to find a place to relax.

Jorge helped me by looking on the local second hand page and even sent messages to sellers on my behalf due to my Spanish is terrible.   The dorm beds are semi private and each comes with individual lights and curtains so was able to stay up late without interrupting anyone or go to bed early without interruption.

The hotel is on a quiet one way street (7th ave) and is a pleasant 10-15 minute walk to the town square with numerous shops and restaurants along the way.  The cost/value proposition is very high. Unlike some other hotels in Antigua, this hotel quotes their rates with the 22% tax already included, so you need to keep that in mind when searching for rates at other hotels. Also, I think their rates are especially low considering what you get in return. 1- Flat screen TV's 2- Free Breakfast 3- Ceiling Fans... this is a big benefit that most hotels in Antigua do not have. 4- 24 hour front desk  5- Security,,,, the door to the hotel is ALWAYS LOCKED. 6- In Room Safes",POS

The hotel has a really nice and colorful patio, in which you can find a beautiful vertical garden. The room is comfortable and according to the price you pay. Breakfast was the best: really delicious and balanced, and only for $5.

What I love most about Casa Florencia is how clean it is.  You can eat off the floors in this hotel!  The staff is friendly too.  They know their guests by first name and go out of their way to make you comfortable while you are away from home.",POS

This is an old Colonial Home that has been transformed into a beautiful hotel.  It is impeccably  clean, the rooms are private and quiet, they are arranged in small groupings facing different interior patios surrounded by the most amazing array of tropical flowers.  The staff is very friendly, always accommodating of all requests. The Hotel has the most amazing terrace on the third floor where you can see the Volcanoes and have a glass of wine while you see the sunset or sunrise. It is located a couple of blocks from the central park and across the street is the Restaurant ""La Fonda Real"" which is a great",POS

We have stayed here many times and the service was consistently attentive, rooms clean with local organic amenities that were a bonus.   The restaurant is wonderful and very romantic at night with the candles lighting the floors and the typical brick ceilings. I love that each suite has a private sitting area and fireplaces.  Gift yourself with the romance package and arrive to rose petals scattered throughout and tons of homemade candles.",POS

The back courtyard is beautiful and the staff is all A+ people! They let us keep our bags all day as we went out and explored before hoping a night bus to Tikal. If you are going here there is also a beautiful restaurant Cafe Sky on the roof! Great drinks and food but a bit pricey compared to elsewhere.  The wifi is good and the atmosphere is super chill. Coming to Antigua? Stay here! It is the best!",POS
20,"I stayed here during as the mudslides hit the nearby lake districts in 2005.  We hit a few blackouts during this period, and they'd enclosed the courtyard because of inclement weather issues (with plastic roofing!).  Our room didn't actually get any hot water on 2 out of the 3 days spent there (one of the reasons I moved to Hotel Plaza Mayor nearby - smaller, but just as charismatic in terms of old spanish style architechture).  We seemed to be alone in our problems on the hot water, but combined with the fact there was no window in the bathroom - a cold shower during the blackout left a lot to be desired.  Breakfast was available - it was cheap, and for the most part very good, but I did have one day where the milk was curdled and the fruit not so fresh.  We didn't bother",NEG

The food is sooooooooooo good and so many options. I stayed an extra 4 days because the vibe was so good and it was nice to be in such a clean place. I usually don't do reviews but I felt this was the least I could do after staying in such a great place. Highly recommended!",POS
30,"We liked our stay at this hotel.   The courtyards is nice and the pool looked good too.   The thing about Antigua is that there are cobble stone streets and noisy tuktuks etc, driving through them throughout the evening/night hours. The first night we had a room on the corner, very nice and large room but noisy!! My only suggestion, get an interior room any place that you stay in Antigua.  But we did like it here! The second night we switched to the room upstairs and behind the front desk, much more quiet. The hotel is pretty deserted after hours so just make sure you are back at a reasonable hour since you cannot get in touch with anyone at odd hours.",NEG
50,"Stayed here for three night in Dec '14, and its location is very central and close to the arch, and city square as mentioned by previous reviews. The rooms and property itself was beautiful and the rooms were adequately equipped and replenished daily. It can get a bit noisy as noise can leak into the rooms if there are people talking in close proximity (probably because my bathroom windows were constantly open).  Breakfast could be had for 5USD daily, but I opted to eat out every morning. There is free wifi around the property and very fast (able to facetime back home daily). I highly recommend this property to anyone planning to go to Antigua, and would undoubtedly return here next time.",POS

I am traveling the world for my job and numerous times through Central america but this is one of very few places I feel right at home and I can not stop looking at the few, eating the most delicious Guacamole and enjoy the home made dinner...to be honest I overeat every time I am there! I love the simplicity of this time but at the same time you can splurge yourself with food, drinks and time in the hammock. If your body and soul needs a break and you simply just want to focus on yourself and let things be...this is the place you want to be. Family style is the key word for Earth Lodge, starting with a super friendly smile and out of the way service! For sure I will be back...very soon!",POS

But it is a pricey option, and you can get the same comfort for a much lesser price if you are prepared to stay a little further from the centre of town. My rating of average is determined by the less than satisfactory service. The check-in staff were exceptionally slow, and showed no urgency to help us on arrival. Further, we were left waiting for 10min outside on the road while trying to get into the hotel at 10:30pm after going out to eat, as the night manager did not respond for some time to the bell.",NEG

We asked to be moved, but were told there weren't any rooms at the rate level we had. I booked a deluxe room and thought it would be air conditioned, it wasn't. I was offered a premium room with air conditioning for $40/night more. The nights in March in Antigua are cool enough that we didn't need A/C but I wouldn't want to stay in this room in July.",POS
40,Stayed here on two occasions and in both cases it was a perfect base in Antigua. The suites are about 5 blocks from the central square of Antigua - walking along cobbled streets. Its in a quiet part of town with all rooms on two levels surrounding a very pleasant internal courtyard. The roof top is large and has some seating and tables - great for some late night drinks looking at the volcano under the stars. The rooms are reasonable size with good facilities - a great shower and bed. We did not have breakfast included so went out each morning (there are some great options nearby.

The rooms are nice if a little dark, staff are nice and location is great.  The major negative for me is how the price is disclosed on the various booking sites. Price is quoted less taxes and charges which in total come to 28%. I feel this is dishonest . We did not experience this in other hotels. If this was sorted I would be happier with the hotel.",NEG

Simply ask for one and they'll facilitate it. The restaurant food is also very good!  The only 2 minor not so good things were the service at the restaurant.  It took ages to be attended to (maybe it was because it was a big group of us on business sitting at different tables.

The entrance to the hotel consisted of a heavy wooden door which got me thinking whether I had made the right choice, but as soon as they opened it, my opinion changed immediately. I was greeted by Brenda which was so nice to us, and she showed us all the hotel (which is, let's not say small but cozy).

The rooms are all first floor and look onto a pretty small courtyard, so they get no light at all.  And the furniture is gothic and depressing.  The mold gets on your clothes by the time you leave!

20,"Reading all the reviews I had to check myself when I first arrived that this was the right 'place to stay'. Whilst I can't really comment on the friendliness of the staff particularly (for me - one night, and I was outta there) in terms of the actual accommodation itself, I'm not sure how you could ever give this place 4 or 5 stars?  Whilst it might have been acceptable 15-20 years ago, I think travellers expectations (even budget travellers) on what constitutes a decent bed & cleanliness is more than what this place delivers. Surely gone are the days of straw mattresses (obviously, they did not have straw mattresses!) and lumpy pillows with superman pillow cases (although that wouldn't surprise me), I'd much rather pay $1 or $2 extra a night for this to be put towards updating",NEG

It's a perfect young 'flashpackers' place, with bar parties most evenings, organised tours, and a reasonably priced laundry service. The narrow roof terrace has intetesting views, the garden hammocks are relaxing, and the kitchen is adequate. The hostel is about one and a half kilometers from the bus park where there is a great open-air market too",NEG

I stayed there on an impromptu trip to Antigua and they immediately guided me to some clothing stores, an amazing italian restaurant down the street and a tour guide for the city as well as a day trip to Panajachel.  The hotel was beautifully manicured and well-kept, the room was clean and overlooked a beautiful waterfall garden.

There was a notice not to flush toilet paper in the toilet, but the wastebasket had no cover, therefore, smells came into the room.  No fan and no window to open in the toilet area.  The bad:  walls were paper thin.  I heard one half of an hour conversation of my neighbor trying to find his lost luggage.

The gardens are well-kept and the pool facility is simple, but welcome on a hot day.  It generally exudes a nice, calm, peaceful atmosphere.  However... While the hotel itself is quiet and relaxing, you can't say the same for the neighbours.  Yes, the location is slightly out of the central part of town, but the property backs on to a very major road. Trucks, motorcycles, chicken buses, and more can be heard all hours of day and night.  Depending on the side of the hotel that your room faces, this may be more or less of an issue.  The pool and restaurant are on the side closest to the busy road, so you won't necessarily have a relaxing resort-like time sitting",POS

Casa couldn't be in a better location, it is both safe and convenient to get to all attractions day and night. It had a cool colonial setting, provided good, free coffee and was clean. I would like to write more positives but as you might have picked up in the slightly sarcastic overview we had several frustrating issues.

We had a deluxe room with a fireplace and a balcony.  It is worth the few extra dollars to upgrade to a deluxe room.  It was large and tastefully decorated.  The bathroom was large for a hotel in Antigua and had a lot of counter space.  Our bathtub leaked a little during our stay, making the floor around the bathtub wet and slippery – but this is the ONLY complaint I have about the hotel.

It's at a walkable distance from the central park (about 9 blocks). Food is good, coffee is great, most of the staff is friendly, however the front desk people were a bit cold and will not make eye contact. The bathroom design is not very smart, there is a step after you open the door and the light switch is beyond the step, so you can easily trip on it in the dark. The shower has a partial wall and that's it, so water gets all over the floor making it very slippery. The pool is pretty and a good size, with warmish water. The little Plaza area is gorgeous and the garden is very well taken care of.",NEG

Antigua can be a noisy place when you stay in the centro area. This place is off the beaten path and thus doesn't suffer the noise. On the flip side, if you are 'on foot' then this is a bit of a distance from the heart of Antigua and not on the normal tuk tuk route.  Parking. I have a car here. So, when I'm looking for a place to stay, secure parking is a must. This hotel is located within a gated community.

The hotel spa is really something special - the owners obviously took great care to have gotten it so right. We all booked massages and checked in to the large indoor/outdoor pool area.

My mom had forgotten a roll of limperas she was saving for Honduras. When we got back to the hotel she went to give them to me and they were nowhere to be found.

One of them even has a tunnel going under the road to get there. The main pool is huge with bar service and the breakfast buffet was pretty good.   The room though was fabulous.

That was huge for us especially coming from hostels that were incredibly disgusting. 3. The ambiance was also A+, tons of space to chill, a TV with Netflix!, and a roof top terrace to watch the sunset/drink a beer. 4.

We stayed in the Junior Suite the first two nights; it is lovely with a private balcony that overlooks the city with great views of the three volcanoes that dominate the skyline.  However, don't rely on the sofa bed for an extra person!  It was old, VERY creaky and incredibly uncomfortable according to my son who spent a relatively sleepless night on it.  Although it was nice having two showers, the downstairs shower water pressure could use some attention.

Eat until you burst for around 100 Q. The atmosphere in the restaurant, open to the ambient air, or pool side is most welcome.

If you are sensitive to that, ask for a more internal room.

Our room was quite spacious with two bathrooms.  One had a toilet and sink and the other a sink and shower.  There is a hairdryer.  Staff at the front desk speak good English and are helpful.  The only negative is that the beds are extremely hard and not much in the way of a pillow.  T  Good selections for breakfast.  Get the fruit plate- it was really nice.,POS

This seemed more geared toward large groups, and business people; not quite what we were after. We were a little disappointed that breakfast was not included in the high price, and we had an issue with a run-on toilet that took multiple calls to the front desk to get resolved.

If you travel like my friend and I do, you end up having a million mini requests for the hostel staff (ex. can we pay via paypall, can you book this for us, can you call them, can you stand on your head for 5 minutes). The staff was really what made the difference for us. Not to say that the rooms aren't good. The rooms are nice and cozy with foam mattresses which aren't crazy loud when someone on the top bunk needs to move. In the end it's really helpful to have a hostel staff that will give you advice and help you make your trip a little smoother. Thanks so much Basecamp!

They held onto our bags while we went away on overnight trips, for a very small fee. They let us check in early and check out late as long as there was room availability. There's only a small number of rooms available (6, I believe) so you're guaranteed a quiet and relaxing experience. I'd definitely stay at this place again if I ever come back to Antigua.",POS

The central  garden is phenomenal and the common areas are beautifully done.  The art throughout the hotel is worth a visit in itself.

Pros: - Relatively quiet the first two days - WiFi in room - Santa Clara Panaderia next door- see their reviews. Very convenient and excellent for breakfast, lunch or dinner - first place in Guatemala we got a king size bed  Cons: - Our room was a bit dark and well used - a bit dusty - Can be noisy- other tenants outside in the courtyard were up late and loud one night  Even though it was nice having the Panaderia next door, be aware it can be noisy. They have loud singing and entertainment on the weekends, and our room backed up against their wall. Luckily they seemed to stop around 10:30-11:00.

Communal showers work fine -- if you understand how the FLOW controls the temperature -- and the whole bathroom area is kept nice and clean.

Our double room on the courtyard was very comfortable, and extremely quiet: because of the position of the hotel, on a kind of dead-end street in the center, with gardens and ruins all around it, there isn't really any traffic noise. Julian, the manager, and the assistant manager Frida were exquisite hosts, helpful in every way, including historical information and invaluable advice on traffic conditions. The breakfast on the terrace was the best that we had in Guatemala, and the views are jaw-dropping. I give this hotel my highest recommendation.",POS

Location near the central area is important in Antigua as you will be able to walk to just about everything you will want to do, and Naif is well located. It is a building perhaps some 20 years old built in a colonial Spanish style with galleries and a courtyard. We understood that it had only just been reopened after having been closed and improvements were being made during our stay. We had a large room with two queen sized beds and ensuite with shower. Our room had nowhere to store our clothes but they added a closet and an additional lamp to improve the lighting. Breakfast was served outside in the courtyard from a limited",NEG

When we got to the hotel, we were taken to our room, which was on the third floor. The room was impeccably clean and had the most amazing view. I was also happy to see they had cable t.v.

Additionally, and with the exception of the nasty Casa Santo Domingo, virtually everyone in Antigua strives to make visitors happy with over the top service. This alone makes it hard to criticize Antigua hotels largely because you don't want an unjaundiced review to reflect badly on waiters, hotel staff and others who have worked hard to make your stay enjoyable.

It's kind of goofy, but endearing.  The rooms vary dramatically in size, often without any change in the price, so it's worth taking a look at the available options before committing to one.  Also, the larger room near the front of the hotel faces one of the busiest streets in town, so it can be pretty loud at night.   The staff is very",POS

The breakfast is top-notch - makes it easy to forget you're in a third-world country - but you do pay for that treat. I was actually over-charged and questioned it after I had paid my bill.

Every bed has curtains and good size lockers which was a big plus for me and they are really comfortable and the rooms are a bit small but clean. There is a pool table and a TV area and they have funny & helpful staff which is especially nice if your travelling alone. They turn the music off at 10:30 which allows you to sleep if you want to and if not you just go out with everybody else. You can book shuttles and some tours directly there, I booked my shuttle to Leon in Nicaragua with them which is an awful 18 hours bus ride but everything went well and I got to the next Bigfoot without any problems.

10,"If you're thinking after reading Lonely Planet that this sounds like a cute place to stay, you're going to be massively disappointed. This hotel is as soulless and corporate as they come in Guatemala, and is absurdly overpriced for what you get. Worst of all, it's impossible to enjoy your stay because of the insane amount of noise.  The rooms are very small, beds rock hard and linens ancient. The lighting feels like you're in a prison cell. The shower is absolutely pathetic. The only way to get hot water is to have the water flow at the bare minimum. Every other hotel I stayed at in Guatemala (and all of which were CHEAPER than this dump) had legitimate hot water.   But most egregiously, this is hands down the loudest hotel I've ever stayed in.

As a way of explanation I was told they had neglected to close down this reservation system  because it is not the one they prefer to use --- which they said was through ""booking.com:""  As compensation they offered to find a place for me at another hotel, which was fine except that my wife and I had specifically selected Casa de los Sueños because it was close to the house where we were scheduled to have dinner, plus the need to find another",NEG

However, if your sleep is easily disturbed by noise and light, this is not the hotel for you! The first night we stayed at ""La Llorona"", it was a disaster. The terraza where guests have breakfast is right above it, so at 6 am they started moving chairs and tables around and we could hear absolutely everything. We complained about it (I´m sure we were not the first ones to do so) and they moved us to ""La Siguanaba"", which was much better but still noisy.

50,I recently returned to San Carlos for a week stay since my last visit was so enjoyable. This time I stayed in the dorm because I was on a little tighter of a budget.  I read the reviews recently about it being very loud and not a comfortable stay in the dorm. I would have to completely disagree.  In fact as a veteran of dorm stays I would have to say this is one of the cleanest and quietest dorms I have stayed in. It is a dorm so I was expecting to not have an ample amount of personal space. It was no more crowded then any other dorm I had stayed in. But much more comfortable and clean then the average. For the equivalent of $9 a night I don't see how people could possible complain.  I went on to read something about the dangers of the shower. The sign reads something like,POS

The thin walls made it easy to hear our neighbors (I could hear our neighbor snoring through the wall and chatting early in the morning).

When I was finally able to go to sleep someone came knocking at our door at 130am asking whether we had booked a taxi?!?! He didn't just knock but also tried to open the door which was infuriating.  The shower doesn't heat up the water properly, there's nowhere to hang up towels...just a very uncomfortable stay over all.  I do NOT recommend this place.

There were some problems with our stay: 1) Transfer from Guatemala city was late and the owner made no genuine apology for this. 2) There was a breakfast disaster on first morning which affected the remainder of our stay. This was the meanest breakfast in our trip through Costa Rica and Guatemala. There is a wide range of options but none is really perfect. The majority are priced at 50 Quetzales with some at 70, and we were told we could have any as they were included in our rate.

For laughing too loudly in my room, having the TV too loud, or laughing in the ""hallway"" once I ran into a large pillar, because they turn off the outside lights after a certain time. Aside from that, he tried to take my roommates room key and the plumbing was probably just turned on the night I got there and I mentioned it to a friend who then asked the front desk about it.

There was nothing particularly fancy about our room, but it was spacious and clean. A tasty breakfast was included each morning, as well as a welcoming beverage when we arrived.

There is no breakfast available - except on Saturday, when you must eat the breakfast there, it's compulsory: another rule.  The place is absolutely spotless.

It seems this hotel caters to large groups and events and hosts these groups which can make the hotel more busy and loud then other hotels.   Unlike other hotels which has drinking water easily available if you want a bottle filled, the front desk person has to go and fill the bottle up for you.

The balcony has stunning views of Volcán de Agua, which towers over Antigua from the south. The rooms themselves are beautifully furnished and kept extremely clean -- it's kind of incredible how much time the cleaning staff spends in the hotel, given how few rooms there are.

The staff and space make it incredibly easy to make friends here. The location is also perhaps the best in Antigua. Right in the middle of everything. Don’t hesitate to stay here.

The hostel does not have breakfast, but there is a very nice café (Fernando´s) next door with a good and cheap breakfast and an unforgettable coffee. We did not really use the kitchen but we did use the terrace upstairs, for a nice sunbathing.

But once we‘ve checked in we were very disappointed: - The kitchen was very dirty, there were bugs everywhere (e.g. in the fridge) - The bathroom was dirty as well, there were backlogs of hair in the shower and the whole area looked pretty uncleaned - The rooftop area was dirty and shabby, dirt everywhere and it looked run-down.

Even though all of the rooms share the bathrooms, it isn't a problem because they are impeccably well kept and the hot water never seems to run out.

Noise was never an issue as the street is out of the way of traffic and is very close to the Cross, which you can hike up early in the morning (so peaceful!).

There are two pick up spots in Antigua (see their website for details) and you just tell them what you want to do at Filadelfia and jump on.

Once there you get dropped off at the Information booth where you pay for your tour and you will be given a start time and off you go in another Unimog around the grounds of the plantation. I was really fortunate to be on a tour where I was the only person after an English speaking guide, the rest spoke some forms of Spanish.

At about US $300. per night B&B after taxes it is expensive but I feel worth it. It is on the top floor of the property, has it's own terrace and bathroom containing a spectacular double jacuzzi bath ( Bill Clinton famously stayed in this suite -- but without Hilary!). The bed is large and comfortable. There are  fireplaces in the bedroom and bathroom for colder nights. I felt that the standard rooms, although $100. per night cheaper, were not such good value.

This room cost us $20 a night.  It was noisy as it is right on the street, but the windows are double paned, there are wood shutters, and insulating curtains. Wear earplugs.  The room has a very musty smell (like old wooden furniture 400 years old!) and has stone walls, so it will remind you of your grandmother's basement and your clothes will come out with an odd odor, but when you are ill with stomach troubles and you need a comfy bed and some entertaining TV to get your mind off your bowels,",POS

Why they were given coffee in reception and not the dining room is beyond me.

Lovely courtyard where yummy breakfast was served, fabulous hanging plants all over, be sure to go all the way to back to find circular stairs up to roof patio with great views of mountains.

For breakfast they serve (usually) the choice of waffles, pancakes, or plato tipico with your choice of eggs.   The staff are all very friendly and hard working.

The hike in is seriously downhill (and thus the hike out is a serious climb uphill), so wear good shoes, bring water and a backpack (no rolly luggage), and don't go if you're not in decent shape.  We visited for the annual cornhole tournament (did not win), and then stayed for a few days afterwards. Given the isolated location, there's not a ton to do (go for a hike in the nearby hills?), but it's a great place to rest and recover, especially if you need to detox after living it up in Antigua.

It's several blocks away from Parque Central and many of the tourist destinations in Antigua, and also has no restaurant on premises.  The rooms are impractically large, which is probably where the high price comes in, and while the gardens are beautiful, there's far more beautiful and interesting things to do in Antigua than relax in the hotel's garden.  But most importantly, the plumbing is spotty.  My reservation for a standard room was outfitted with a great shower, but no hot water.

The main downside of the Grand Suite was the noise particularly when you get a large group of loud diners sitting below or live music (which is most nights) . So if you like to go to sleep early this may not be for you. The other downsides of the hotel are a) it is a little way from the centre and the sidewalk is not in good shape so it is not for the unfit, and b) the terraces are not private, but shared.

She helped my boyfriend to get mariachis at the hotel with a two hours short notice to proposed to me at the hotel. Susan even made an excellent video of our engagement. We will never forget how nice they were with us and how they helped us to make such a special moment. They were sincerely happy to making us happy. Well done Casa Florencia and thank you Susan!",POS

The interior is very cosy, excellent breakfast (eggs made to your taste, pancakes,...), located in a quiet street but just a few minutes from the main square. The views are amazing, from where you can see el fuego erupting. We really loved this place! The only thing we recommend is that they serve breakfast a little earlier (it starts from 7.30 am, while a lot of shuttles leave at 8 am and you have to be there 15 minutes before). Overall, great place!",POS
30,Stayed 7 nights with a mission trip & we rented out the entire place because the group was so large.  We shared a king bed room which was spacious & bed was fairly comfortable. Bathroom small but fine with a shower. Room was cleaned every day. There is no safe for storing of valuables. The hot water ran out every morning & every evening because we filled all the rooms & that was disheartening after really long days of hard work to have a cold shower unless we got to the showers faster than some of our peers on the trip.  There is filtered water available throughout the hotel & you need to be very careful. Don’t brush your teeth or even rinse your mouth with tap water. Also note - some windows are wood doors or shutters w/o glass. The rooms get very hot & uncomfortable & some,NEG

Beautiful and peaceful building, amazing staff who spoke good English and delicious, local-style breakfast. Worth every penny.",POS
40,Overall we would recommend Casa Madeleine to fellow travelers. The service was friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was delicious and the hotel is very beautiful. A couple of drawbacks are that it really isn't close to the center of town. Probably a fifteen minute walk but at night we choose to take a cab since it felt a bit secluded. We also opted for the couples massage which wasn't the greatest and felt very rushed.,POS

The view is also spectacular, however the cabin is a little larger than the treehouse.  The communal style dinners are hearty and good value.   Staff were friendly and attentive.  Happy hour was a perfect way to watch the sun go down behind the mountains!",POS
30,Hotel is centrally located so accessing the landmarks in Antigua is easy on foot. Hotel is old style charm but not in the luxury category. Could do with some updating but was comfortable enough although if our room had only one double bed we would have had a lot more room.

The plane in the middle of the patio is one of the coolest things you’ll ever see; you can just feel a good vibe around the hostel, it makes you want to stay there longer!

Will definitely go back :-)",POS

Denise at the front desk was fantastic - so friendly and helpful. The hotel was secure and the courtyard was inviting and relaxing. Our room was comfortable with a large bathroom. There is also a safe in the room. I liked the location of this hotel, within walking distance to everything, yet just outside of the busy streets surrounding the main square. We felt safe walking back here late at night. We passed the hotel several times, however - it is a little bit hard to spot. Antigua is great, it is beautiful. There are cool ruins, beautiful churches, good restaurants, fun shopping and nice drinking establishments as well. Dancing, too.",POS

Our room was beautiful and very clean! Plus they have a turn down service every night and you get a small treat!   We got the shuttle through them to and from the airport and it was really nice.

The hostel itself is conveniently located in Antigua. The rooms are clean, with spacious bathrooms and decently-comfortable beds. But what makes the Terrace what it is, is the people!

During our stay, there was an unseasonably cold day, and the staff happily brought us a space heater for the room when we requested it.  The restaurant is very good (though a bit pricey).

The staff are helpful and although it is difficult if you have no Spanish, we got by. However, the reason I cannot give this hotel top marks is the lack of cleanliness in the bedroom and bathroom.  The valance was grubby and the sheets and towels although clean were very threadbare.  There was dust on the all the skirting boards and the whole room could have done with a clean. The bathroom needed a really good clean, I don't think the floor had been washed behind the door for a very long time.  I ended up cleaning it myself, rather than let it bother me on a daily basis.

When the doctor came he didn't know inglish! I don't know why they send me this doctor but it wasn't ok!,POS

The grounds were lovely, the hotel laid out like a village street, the second floor restaurant beautiful.  We had a corner room which was quite dark when we closed the curtain for privacy and the lighting didn't help.  The bathroom was fine.  This hotel didn't supply water, unlike many other hotels we stayed in during our tour.  The hotel is a long walk from the center of Antigua.  We had dinner in the hotel restaurant our first night and it was fine, the wine potable.  The breakfast buffet was mediocre.

50,"The Porta Hotel Antigua is GORGEOUS!!  Seriously.  We had the opportunity to stay in both the ""new"" and the ""older"" sections of the hotel.  The rooms in both sections are lovely.  In the newer section, separated from the main area of the hotel by an underground tunnel, the rooms are tiny bit fancier, but the advantage of staying in the ""older"" section is that you have direct access to the pool (and to the playground, for those of us with small children).  The breakfast buffet was sumptuous.  The hotel is located on a nice side street, not too far away from Parque Central.  If I could afford it, I'd have stayed here for the entire trip!!",POS

The staff are very helpful. We were here for the ""Burning of the Devil"" traditional ceremony nearby. We able to walk to most historic attractions of Antigua. We can only anticipate when we will return.",POS
50,"All the reviews are accurate - having booked back in December we were very pleased with our early choice, especially at Semana Santa.  On Good Friday we were blessed with a very early morning parade and one in the late evening right past the accommodation.  This also meant we literally had our own private carpets being made down the street - twice!  Although that sounds as though it was a busy place to be - it wasn't.  It is small and a little walk into town offering us a peaceful getaway, which is an important aspect to my mothers and my holidays.  Friendly staff, good location, quiet, clean and spacious! Great morning cappuccino, too!",POS
30,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Room #1 for 3 nights. The hotel is beautiful. The staff is friendly and bilingual. The free breakfast is also pretty good. Unfortunately, our experience was less than satisfactory.   We were woken up each of the 3 mornings between 6:30-7:30am to extremely loud sounds coming from the second floor. Above our room is the terrace. Each morning it sounded like furniture being moved. The noise lasted 20-40 minutes and it was LOUD.  It made it impossible to sleep, even over our two bedroom fan phone apps. We complained to the receptionist the second morning, but it didn't help. The noise continued that morning and the next.   Also, our toilet ran constantly, the sink faucet never got hot, didn't drain properly and had really loose handles. Plus, our room",NEG

The price was extremely reasonable.  Staff was very kind.  Our room was huge. It was room #8. Had a beautiful view of the gardens, very spacious, even the bathroom.  I highly recommend this B&B. Only so-so thing was that we didn´t have good wi-fi signal in the bedroom.",POS

40,"At the end of a two week trip to visit Mayan sites in Mexico and Guatemala, we traveled to the beautiful colonial city of Antigua and splurged on this old gem well located near the heart of the city. We stepped in through the doors and found ourselves in a beautiful courtyard full of flowers and a great fountain. The reception staff speaks English and is helpful, providing information about the history of the building. We stayed in room VI called Paula on the second floor. The room is large and well appointed but is very dark and poorly lit by electricity. There is a small window high on the wall to the outside and two large windows to the veranda overlooking the courtyard. We had dinner in the courtyard around the garden. When the evening became chilly, we moved into the",POS
30,Room was large with good shower. But because all rooms surround a courtyard it is very noisy as you hear everyone coming & going & also the doorbell which you have to ring each time you enter.

I was impressed by the very helpful staff that helped me arrange transportation to and from the airport and even helped send a package for me while I was staying with them.

40,"(+) Room 9 - nice view on the volcano, especially cool in the mornings.   Joseph is very friendly and helpful guy at the reception.  The hostel has good good breakfast options, which can be ordered at 7. If you are awake earlier, you can eat at cafe Barista, which is open at 6. The hostel offers a family dinner on Monday at 7 p.m. I recommend to try chicken burrito for 48 quetzals. It is quite big and can be shared. The staff members are aware of environment issues and offer water refill for 2 qtz per 0.5l.   If you order a shuttle, be sure that you inform the personel which airport you need, otherwise you might pay additional 50 qtz to get from the International to Municipal airport.   (-) Be aware that the hostel is not the place for those, who like silence. It might be loud",POS
30,"The hostel had wonderful amentities. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were clean. The showers were hot! Breakfast is included in the overnight price, and the typical Guatemalan dish was delicious. However, the coffee could have been stronger!   The only downfall to this hostel is that the staff is made up of volunteers. So depending on when you stay, the experience could be made better or worse by the particular volunteers. I would suggest finding a travel agency around Antigua to acquire information becuase the staff was uninterested in answering questions. In addition, one of the rules of the hostel is to respect other guests by keeping the volume at bay while others are sleeping. While the other guests were very respectful of this, the staff stayed up late",NEG

We were able to store luggage in a locked room, since we arrived well before check-in.

30,". Background: Our group stayed at this hotel on the final night of our 3-week Central American tour.   PROS: Location... location... location is its best asset. Centrally-located just one block from La Merced square, it is mere steps away from shops and restaurants. The hotel's façade incorporates old Spanish colonial design elements with its large wooden gated entrance and reflected in the room's furnishings. There are a variety of rooms available from doubles (patio) to quad rooms (garden view), most of whom face an open central courtyard. My bedroom (#11) on the ground floor was reasonably sized and clean. Having a roof terrace with a city view is a nice touch. Free WiFi and internet access doesn't hurt, either. For the most part, service is friendly and accommodating. They",NEG

The girl on reception spoke perfect English and helpedmus out when our car window was smashed, and to arrange a fedex parcel delivery.  The night guard also kept an eye on our car as we couldn't fit it in their garage, though they are widening the entrance so even our massive pickup should now fit in.  $100 a night, including a lovely breakfast of eggs and fruit and bread.  Comfy rooms, great showers and loads within walking distance.  Would highly recommend a visit and will definitely stay again if in Antigua.",POS

I did expect some serene atmosphere (looking to the pictures), but it turned out to be an overcrowded place.",NEG

Great room sizes, huge bathrooms, and very clean with air conditioning. The views from the pool area are stunning. You will not want to leave the hotel, but will do so because you cannot miss out on everything Antigua has to offer.

The owner Mr. Diaz was very helpful in providing us with accurate information of the city and requesting reliable transportation during our stay.

I think the first night, we were the only guests. It is very secure, with the door always locked, but staff at the ready to unlock for the guests. Not on the street: it is about a half-block inside a compound. The one disadvantage is that it is about six blocks from the center square, and consequently not a place if you want to be in the center of the activity. The first two blocks of walking to the square is on a section of street with a non-existent sidewalk, but that street is not very busy.   The address is difficult to find. The hotel should make sure to provide directions on the website.",NEG

We stayed for four nights, in two of the master suites (Dona Leonor and Don Pedro), and we loved our rooms.  However, the service was patchy at best, and there is much that could be done to improve the client experience.  What was missing - - a do not disturb sign - a mini bar - some way of making coffee or tea in the room - a bar that was open past nine pm if no mini bar in the room - some assistance in explaining the hotel amenities (there was nothing in the room, and we found the pool by accident) - proper wifi - it was very sporadic and weak, and for $300 they could easily by a router booster  and what was",NEG

I booked a single room with a shared bathroom but the hotel ended up giving me a large triple room with a huge patio for the same price ($50 per night). The rooms are nicely decorated in tranquil Myan décor. The rooms and shared bathroom were extremely clean and the cleaning staff were very sweet. The staff changed the sheets daily and they cleaned the bathroom throughout the day. The hotel had internet access and computers in the reception area for a very decent price. The only reason I could not give the hotel a 5 is because the loud music from the club next door from about 9pm to 1am disturbed me.
