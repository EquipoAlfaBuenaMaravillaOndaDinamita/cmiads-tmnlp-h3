50,"I would definitely stay here again in Antigua.  It was perfect - the property is beautiful, it was very clean and comfortable, the location is fantastic, there's a great rooftop deck, and the people are very friendly.  There are cheaper places to stay - I paid $35 USD / 280 quetzales for the best room (room 12) - but Casa Cristina is worth it if you can afford it.  Use the tour agency at the hospedaje next door for transportation (they will recommend them at the front desk) - he is super friendly and reliable, and speaks English.  I used a different tour booker when I got into Antigua and got ripped off (van never showed up), but he salvaged my day by getting replacement transportation very quickly, and even waited with me to make sure it showed up.  Then I booked a volcano hike",POS
40,"Great location, in the heart of historic centre. Just one minute to walk to see one of the most beautiful church. The street where' s located is one way and a few narrow, but very quiet. Rooms small, but very clean. Staff helpful, the lady managing has given us for three days the Lonely Planet., very kind. Free wi-fi and internet at reception, and water or tea too. For a budget option in Antigua is very recommended.",POS
50,"Not only the place is nice, clean and in an excellent location, but our host Fernando was also very helpful and caring to ensure our stay was the best possible in La Antigua. I will definitely go back for a longer stay since this was a short weekend trip, and I will highly recommend it to anyone looking for a personalized attention and excellent customer service",POS
50,"We spent two nights and I wish we could have stayed longer.  The staff was very thoughful and helpful.  The rooms are nicely decorated and very clean.  Make sure to go to the roof level for beautiful views of Antigua.  The breakfast you get with your stay offers a nice variety of fresh fruit, and authentic Guatemalan dishes.  I agree with other reviews, this lovely hotel is centraly located and all the good restaurants and shops are within a 1-2 minute walk.  I hope to return next year.  Gracias por todo su atención!!!",POS
50,"I just recently returned from Antigua and my stay at Casa Florencia. I would highly recommend this hotel. its location is perfect. everything is only five minutes walk away. The rooms are basic but absolutely spotless. i have never seen a hotel that clean. The bathroom was great. I just loved having a nice hot shower every morning. The staff consistently went out of their way to help me whenever i needed it. Stay here, you will not regret it. It also has free wi-fi, and a internet computer in the main lobby.  in my opinion the best 3 places to eat are cafe condessa, cafe bourbon, and Hectors.....",POS
40,"Really a nice and clean place to stay with a family atmosphere, great rooftop views, access to a kitchen and great staff. We were very comfortable here.  Internet and Wifi access available, coffee service onsite, walking very close to the central plaza and anything else in Antigua.  Restaurants within walking distance as well as a small tienda across the street.",POS
40,"The staff are great and there's great food on offer.  The courtyard provides a nice place to relax with hammocks, comfy seats and a fountain, a welcome escape from the noise out in the town.  When I arrived I felt like I was walking into a night club!  So if you have an early start and need an early night you might need some earplugs, but it didn't seem to go on too late.",POS
20,"We stayed at this hotel after reading so many glowing reservations. Our room was on the first floor. It was  very small and dark, although had a patio in the back with a table a chairs. The worst part of the experience was that people were eating at tables a mere 6 feet from our bathroom and toilet. Forks were rattling anf people talking incredibly close to us and the food smells were unsettling as well. The upstairs rooms looked lovely. Make sure you get one of those. The place  has a great breakfast and the terraces upstairs have amazing views and flowers.  We stayed also at  Casa Encantada and Posada de Don Rodrigo, both were excellent and we liked them much better. ",NEG
40,"Second stay here in 2 weeks. This is a typical Antigua very old converted building; built around gardens and fountains with flowers everywhere. 4 minutes to the central park.  It's not fancy, maybe a bit worn, but the prices aren't fancy either. As others have said, the farther back you are the quieter it is (avoid 8 and 9 if possible). Roof top space with decent views of the mountains. ",POS
50,"It was amazing! The service is great, food is very good, family style dinner rocks as awell as Sunday BBQ’s... great view, cool people, if you visit it once you are probably going to want to go back.... I recomend arriving by the earthlodge private transportantion, its cheap and way more practical.",POS
50,Arrived last night in Antigua and we were looking for some breakfast. Just passed by this lovely place and had to come in. Very kind service and just perfect breakfast with a lot of fruit! We had the continental and antigueno breakfast which was served with awesome pees. Just the Orange juice wasn't fresh I believed. Tomorrow we'll be back! Never change a winning breakfast.. ,POS
40,Loved the Meson de Maria. It is not luxurious but oozes charm. The staff were delightful and breakfast (in the courtyard) delicious. Lovely rooftop terrace with stunning views of the surrounding countryside and volcanoes. We went to visit some more expensive hotels in Antigua but none of them really offered any more than we had here.,POS
50,"My wife and I stayed 4 nights at Casa Cristina.  The manager, Rosario, was very helpful with suggestions and very easy to deal with.  The place is in an excellent location.  Just a 3-5 minute walk to the hub of the nightlife, and another 5 mins to Central Park.  Also a major plus is that Fernando Kaffe (serving the best coffee in Antigua) is a couple of doors down.  We stayed in room #1 (which is by the entrance with a window to the street).  I'd recommend another room if available just because you do hear noise in the morning and it will wake you up.  Luckily for us, we were waking up at 5 or 6 AM daily for planned activities so it wasn't too much of a problem.  For the price you're paying, you are getting very high value for such a clean and centrally located hotel.",POS
50,"I stayed here in January 2012. I loved the hostel. All the guests were very friendly and the hostel felt like home. There are a lot of communal areas like a livingroom with a TV and DVDS which is very comfortable, the kitchen is the best kept and nicest hostel kitchen I have seen! There's another table upstairs, plus the rooftop which is the best part of it all! The views of the city and the volcano are beautiful. The dorm is small but the beds were the most comfortable of all the hostels I stayed at in Guatemala.  It's quiet yet it's social.... it's the perfect place to stay. Also the hostel offers the volcano tour for a cheaper price than the tour agencies. They also offer shuttle service to different places and like others said the woman working speaks english really well.",POS
50,"Friendly staff, eager to help. Clean rooms and common areas. Nice patio out back, perfect for a relaxing breakfast. I'm sure most of the breakfast options are good, I wouldn't know. The pancakes were so good I ate them 7 days in a row.",POS
40,"Stayed there for 2 nights last week. The location is great, just one block from the heart of the city. No matter which direction you go, you'll find a great restaurant, bar, store a short walk away. If you might have any question, ask for Ever. He speaks very good English and will help you with all of your needs. The rooms are clean and just standard ones. Smaller than the US travelers are used to, but just enough for sleeping. Do not forget to get on the terrace and snap a picture of the Fire Volcano when smoking. Do not need to wait for long because smoke is spewed out almost every minute. Good overall experience with this hostel / hotel.",POS
40,"I stayed at the porta for a friends wedding week. It was one of the best places I've ever stayed. First, the breakfasts are amazing. Cooked to order omlets, crepes, fresh fruit and juices to name a few. Second, my room was amazing, near the pool and it had a little patio to have my morning coffee on. It was the perfect location to be able to walk around and explore the city all day. I would love to be able to go back again soon.",POS
50,I was super relieved to find this place after a few nights in a busy party hostel. They offer dorms as well as affordable basic rooms. Perfect place if you want to save money yet avoid sleeping in a dorm room,POS
50,"Found this hotel in my guidebook and read the great reviews on Tripadvisor.  I totally enjoyed my stay here in this lovely hotel.  The front desk staff are friendly and helpful.  I wasn't feeling well so the gentleman at the front desk volunteered to carry my luggage upstairs for me.  Tip: check in is 12:30.  I was a little early but availed myself to the tea, internet and lovely rooftop patio (amazing views).  I was in room #8 (no outside view, can easily hear people in hallway) very clean. Room: a double and private bathroom (all rooms have a private bathroom which is awesome).  Amenities: soap, shampoo/conditioner, hand/bath/floor towel, hot water (like all places I've been to so far in Guatemala, you have to turn it on low pressure to fully enjoy the hot water), wifi.

10,"The service at the hostel was pleasant as the days went on although initially the receptionist wasn't interested in us checking in. After a long bus ride we dumped our bags and opted to go up to the terrace for some food, very bad idea! What we received was terrible, nothing more than microwaved (which you could see them doing behind the bar) beans and tortilla chips not the nachos with sweet potato as described! After being very disappointed by the food we thought we would shower to freshen up in my 3 months of travelling I haven't used bathrooms that smelt as horrific as they do! Slept good, the beds were comfortable! But don't be mislead by breakfast being included as it isn't! ",NEG

50,"I've been using this hotel for about 12 years (2-3 per year). It is a bit out of the way but for me it has been worth it. Facilities are beautiful, staff is courteous and very helpful, good breakfast & excellent coffee. I've stayed at many other hotels in La Antigua but always come back to this hotel.",POS
50,"Puedo decir con toda seguridad que este lugar es muy agradable, es tranquilo y limpio. nos gusto mucho la atención, el precio no esta mal, nos hospedamos 6 personas por el fin de semana. lo que nos gusto mucho es que aunque entramos tarde en la noche, nos permitieron entrar y como cuidan que los huespedes que ya estan durmiendo sean respetados. asi que solo nos pideron que no fueramos a hacer ruido para no interrumpir a los otros huespedes, eso  en lo personal me gusto mucho, ya que vimos como se preocupan que todos tengamos lo que estamos buscando, unos poder descansar y otros poder disfrutar de la estancia en La Antigua. nos gusto. me gusto, lo puedo recomendar.  hasta la proxima visita",POS
40,"We arrived late to Guatemala City and had a shuttle arranged through the hotel waiting for us.  Everything was re-confirmed the day before and we were given phone numbers in case we needed to contact anyone in transit.  Our stay was brief, but the room was clean and there was a nice breakfast place right next door.  The staff were friendly and really helpful when the tour company forgot to get us the next day - they called them for us a few times and allowed us to store our bags there in the meantime.  There's also a beautiful rooftop terrace with nice views!",POS
50,"I stayed here for ten nights. The price was within my budget. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean and was cleaned on a regular basis. Breakfast is included and is served between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. and there are seven options to choose from on the menu. I had a wonderful time eating breakfast out in the garden. It's in a quiet location of Antigua and a short walk to Central Park and other locations. There is wifi and a common area, which includes a TV and a pool table. There is also a travel agency, a bar and a restaurant on site and there are Spanish schools in the neighbourhood as well as nice places to eat. I felt very safe in this area. When I had a problem, the staff helped me resolve it. I would definitely stay here again.",POS
50,"I stayed in the Earth Lodge a few years ago.....was in the tree house for a few nights solo....i enjoyed my time there very much and the tree house is an interesting experience for this NYC person.  the food was great and the other people at the dining area were friendly and fun.  overall, worthwhile....peaceful, above Antigua, quiet......",POS
50,"We loved the spacious rooms on the ground floor, which were also reasonably priced. Just the toilet alone was bigger than some other rooms we stayed in in Central America. There wasn't a room the night we arrived, but Daniel went out of his way to make sure we had a room at a sister B&B, and drove us back the following day. He also gave us an excellent summary of what the town had to offer, in terms of sights and where to eat. The place is on the southwestern edge of the old town, which is quite walkable too. Not too far out, and not too noisy at night.",POS
50,Stayed for 5 days in a 12 mixed dorm. Everything is super clean. Kitchen is well equipped. Daily breakfast overs a wide range of different things. Super delicious. Staff is super helpful and friendly. Every bed got their own curtains for some privacy and plugs for sharing your belongings. In the afternoon cake is offered for free. Little quite spot to enjoy the city of Antigua. Highly recommend this spot.,POS
40,"This hostel is a really good place to stay, it's cheap, REALLY clean and it is located in the center of the city. My boyfriend and I stayed in the private room for three days and the reason we don't give the hotel top ratings is due to the noise from the road outside the private room, so bring earplugs. But we would definitely come back!",POS
40,"Casa Madeleine is a lovely B&B in Antigua.  It is a few minutes outside of town and secluded behind a gated wall.  Inside you discover lovely grounds and beautifully decorated bedrooms.  The rooms feature balconies that look out at the volcano and have breathtaking views.  Between the bedrooms, the view and the setting, the whole experience is very tranquil and relaxing.   Service is great, breakfast is either served in it's own dining room with tables outside if you like or delivered to your room. A plus is the spa that is part of the B&B, featuring steam room, jacuzzi and two massage roooms.  A word of advice - we found some of the massages to be a little too rough - just speak up and the pressure will be adjusted.",POS

50,"Francisco has just recently open and is daily making improvements and all for the better; Fluent in english  he goes out of his way to accommodate, very knowledgable, his family is great and also very helpful; Antigua has many attractions out of the bustle and hustle of big city; A great place to unwind or rest up for the next leg of you journey, I had intended to stay 3 days and stayed 3 weeks. While visiting if you need something, just ask and Frisco will help you find it.",POS
30,"This is a small establishment that is kid friendly. It is nice they have a playground for the kids but it is loud. There are small windows to open to get some air but then you hear all of the noise from the courtyard. There is no air conditioning in the rooms and the rooms get hot. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are big. Small bathroom with no room to put anything anywhere. The worst part is the time it takes to get breakfast. It is included but it takes almost an hour to get your breakfast. Plus if you are there many days it is only the same thing every day, which gets old if you are there a week. The hotel itself is pretty nice but there are so many places to stay in Antigua that provide a better value. ",NEG
40,"Pros:  1) Excellent location. 1.5 blocks from the arch, 2.5 blocks from the Central Park. Walk anywhere quickly. 2) Very safe. The top drawer of the nightstand locks, providing a safe place to store passports, extra cash, etc. In addition, the front desk is always staffed, and the main entrance is locked in the evenings. 3) Beautiful gardens and grounds.  4) Clean.  5) Hot water in the shower with great water pressure.   Cons: 1) Excellent location. You’re in the heart of the action, which means you do get some noise from the surrounding neighborhood. There is nothing the hotel can do about the noise from outside the hotel…either join the fun or bring ear plugs. (To be fair, we only were bothered by the noise on Saturday night.)  2) I have arthritis, and found the beds to be",POS
50,"Our group stayed at this hotel for eight nights. The staff made us feel right at home, as well as very safe with the 24-hour reception and locked front door at night. Breakfast was wonderful (thank you to Claudia and Carolina for the extra effort!), and the rooms were very comfortable. I made a big mistake with my shower faucet that caused a flooding in my room. Rather than take me to task for my carelessness, the staff went to work removing the water and made me feel as if it were no big deal. I can't imagine many establishments treating their guests quite as well in a similar situation. All in all - a wonderful hotel, and the Mayan gift store is wonderful too.",POS
50,"A hostel obsessed with cleanliness !  Staff appeared to be permanently cleaning the floor and rooms.  Staff were particularly friendly, especially Flore de Maria in reception.  The roof terrace is pleasant & there is a kitchen but I didn't use it so I don't know how well equipped it was.  The 4 bed dorms are very tight for four people if each had a bag in the room.  However, there are bag sized lockers outside the room.   I wanted to change my booking a few days in advance but hostel refused until I said I'd make a review accordingly. Then the manager changed his tune.  it would have been better if it had been agreed without that threat.",POS

50,"We stayed in Antigua at Chez Daniel for 5 nights and then used it as a stopover point while traveling between Copan, Honduras, Lake Atitlan, and Monterrico Beach (before heading to the airport).  On our last stop at Chez Daniel, I asked our 14 year old daughter if it felt like we were home - and she laid down on the bed, smiled, and nodded yes.  We stayed in 3 different units (#'s 1, 2, and 3).  There are only 4 units here.  2 up and 2 on the ground floor.  Unit 3, on the second floor, had fantastic views of Volcan de Agua.  Units 1 and 2 don't have those views (they have garden views), but probably have a little more cross-ventilation (it can get warm on some afternoons) and may be a tad quieter.

30,"The hotel is only a couple of blocks from the central park in Antigua and another block the other direction to the market, so the location was great!  The beds were comfortable, although for that time of the year in Antigua, we were a little chilly in the room.  The private bathroom was small but most important, had hot water in the shower.  We paid Q100 per night for the room (total price for 2 persons).  My wife insists on a private bathroom and this is by far the best hotel for the price that we've found in Antigua.

50,"My family and I loved our 8 night stay here over Christmas, after much deliberation (and we did cancel one other reservation we had in stead favouring the Porta Hotel only 3 weeks before we were due to arrive) we made an excellent choice.  We stayed in a junior suite and had our own living area and a small courtyard patio. Ideal with a toddler. I requested a cot for the room however when we arrived the sofa bed in the living room was made up. When I spoke to the staff on reception everyone sprung into gear and within 30mins we had a moveable cot (on wheels - ideal for our room to move it away from the tv if we had it on) and the sofa bed reverted back to a sofa.

Unfortunately I ripped a muscle in my back on Christmas day (there may have been alcohol involved!). The staff and volunteers were amazing at looking after me and I've ended up staying nearly 3 weeks while I recovered. Unfortunately I wasn't able to do the volcano tour due to my injury but everyone who did it through the hostel seemed to have a great time if a little exhausted afterwards.

Our room was located on the ground floor with the inner courtyard in front of us.  The first thing we noticed was the smell...horrible like mothballs and our first thoughts were yes mothballs because of bugs.  We suffered through 2 nights of that smell when I discovered it was a bar that was hanging off the toilet chamber.  I threw it away and eventually the smell left the room.  Also make note that if you are there on a Saturday night they have a dj play till 10 and it's pretty loud.

It is incredible to see something so well preserved. As for the rooms, they are extremely comfortable and it's good to have showers with warm water.

We had two units...one a standard hotel room in the main building and a one-bedroom unit in the Villas. The hotel room is roomy, with a fireplace, good beds and very clean. The one bedroom unit is roomy but has poor lighting. Although the property is lovely, we wished the resort had been designed with patios or balconies off the units...there really is no outdoor space with privacy.

Someone pointed out earlier that their slusing door wouldn't lock.  We found this to be true in our unit as well.  I ended up using the dustpan handle as a door lock, which worked alright.

For anyone who has responsibilities or needs to sleep at any point or have a moment of quiet at any point, this place is not suitable. I’m a bit in shock with how rude and loud it is. It has been blaring music since i got here. I have my door shut, and all I can hear is that loud music and party.   This is also extremely overpriced for Antigua.

The accommodations were clean, as I shared a 4-bed dorm with several awesome Aussies. This is a great location for those spending a week (or a month!) in Guatemala. The entire country is accessible from Antigua.  Pros: Cheap beer at the bar! Awesome-looking private suites. Free breakfast! The hostel set up transportation for me to the airport and other towns.

There was always someone from the staff available at the front desk and they vetted anyone entering the hotel through a small window before allowing them to enter.

Their continental breakfast far exceeded our expectations, with hard boiled eggs, fresh delicious fruit, banana nut bread, pastries, and our favorite: chuchitos!

The restaurant was nice and the food was pretty good, but service is slow (as is the norm in Antigua) and the buffets are over priced (I recommend ordering off the menu-just as good).

If you have next door neighbours you'll hear what they're talking about. When a car, bus, lorry or motorbike passes on the street outside you'll definitely hear it.

I would also recommend trying to get a room on the second floor, or in the back courtyard if you don't want the noise of passersby in front of your room.

The attention to detail is something that really stands out in this hostel and cleaning staff work extremely hard at keeping the hostel spotless.  I loved hanging out in the hammocks in the courtyard, reading my book and sipping on their amazing and free coffee in the morning. And of course watching volcan Fuego erupt at night!!!  The staff do an amazing job at making everyone feel welcome and are super helpful for booking tours etc. I always felt safe and the dorms have lockers to keep your stuff safe.   Would recommend this hostel",POS
50,I stayed in this hostel with my girlfriend and we were so happy we did. The location is really Central and there is a great restaurant next door with typical Guatemalan food which is surprisingly difficult to find in Antigua when you want to actually sit down and eat. Above all the staff was incredible. The man (I think the owner) always made us feel right at home by always calling us by name and helping us to get around the city. He even went as far to offer us a ride to our next hostel in his car as he was going home after his shift. ,POS
50,"My daughter, my friend and I were in Antigua, Guatemala during the Holy Week.  We stayed at the Casa Florencia and had a wonderful time.  The accommodations were great...everything was spotless, the staff and owners were lovely, breakfast was great...especially the banana bread.  The hotel is located a few minute walk from the center of town...however, that was not at all a problem...in fact it was much more quiet.  The processions passed the hotel during the Holy Week so that made it more comfortable for us.  The volcano is breathtaking as you view it from outside your hotel room.  There is no doubt in my mind that I would return to Casa Florencia when going back to Antigua.",POS
50,"So I'm a budget traveler looking for a good deal on accommodation. When I found C & T, I was amazed to discover that despite the extremely low cost, I didn't have to compromise on anything! I was given a large comfortable tent all to myself (so much better than a dorm room; I can leave my stuff as unorganized as I want) which included a mattress, good quality (and clean) sleeping bag, towel, and soap/shampoo. The bathroom was always clean and the shower heads provided hot water. I cook for myself, so I was delighted to find a fully stocked kitchen. Emily and the staff are great and super helpful. They'll also love to patiently help you work on your Español ;-) Definitely recommend!!",POS
30,"It is difficult to find a good place in Guatemala for around $30.  Casa Cristina is a good solution if that is your budget and you want a private room and bathroom in a central location.  It is very basic and no frills. Bathroom is outdated and small but clean and hot showers.  Bed is not the most comfortable but it is suitable for a night or two.  Nothing to rave about here, but it is a reliable budget/value hotel.  We booked online and paid our deposit through paypal.  When we arrived, the man did not speak English but he understood my limited Spanish and showed us a few rooms before we decided on the first floor room. We needed a place to shower and crash in between transfers so this suited our needs just fine.",NEG

The rooms are equipt with all that one would need... even if your airline lost your luggage. The beds and pillows were very comfortable.

There is a certain, old-world feel about this hotel that I found quite charming, and the views are great from the hotel's rooftop.  ... But my stay here wouldn't be outstanding, if not for Beatriz and her staff. Beatriz was very kind and understanding, and she made all the effort to help me with all my plans. Even though breakfast starts at 7:30 AM, she still made me breakfast before my 6 AM tour to Pacaya. When I informed her that I had a Copan (Honduras) tour the next day that starts at 3 AM, she suggested to pack my breakfast. I was quite surprised when I saw her awake at 3 AM, only to ensure that I get my packed breakfast before",POS

In doing so it has attracted some of the most immature clientele, the laziest volunteer workers and unfortunately the newest guests were a hoarde of bed bugs.  Long story: We arrived at tropicana Hostel after a 12 hour journey from Semuc Champey. Initially it seemed fairly nice but on walking to the main area we found the bar crowded and roaring techno music.  Our room was situated right opposite the bar so there was no chance of getting a good night's sleep after our long journey.

The location is perfect , close to the Main square and Cathedral with many restaurants and bars in close proximity. The hotel is small with 6 delightful rooms each name after a local legend. Breakfast is taken on the roof with a beautiful view of the Agua Volcano. However what made the stay so delightful was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. They all made  my wife and myself so welcome. When we returned from a 4 day trip to Flores and Tikal it felt like returning to family. There was even a box of local candies in our room to welcome us back. We are definitely looking forward to returning to D'Leyenda and Antigua in the near future.",POS

The building is in the  classic colonial style, with a central courtyard and a beautiful roof patio from which you can watch the sunset and sunrise and see the entire city surrounded by the volcanos.

When reading the reviews I saw that it was top rated by plenty of people and only a few wrote negatively about the place, so thinking it was a sure deal we booked it for 3 nights. Unfortunately it is probably one of the only hostels I stayed at where ultimately the bad reviews were the more accurate ones.

The location is great... only a short walk away from the noise of Parque Central. My room was incredible and very spacious, with cast iron chandeliers, a soaking tub, comfortable couches, and a huge fireplace.

Hostal Las Marias is a wonderful escape from the noise and cars of La Antigua- all just a short walk away- or a tuk-tuk for 5Q. ** if you travel with you bike, the friendly staff accommodate bike storage and even offered a hose for me to clean my bike after a ride.

The sign out front said that you could stay for as little as $18 per night. If that’s true, it’s a good deal, but this is far from the nicest place in Antigua. It is reasonable, though if you want to be close to the center of town and are on a budget.  The Hotel is located a block from the main plaza, so the location is great. While most of the hotels in Antigua are hidden behind walls with pretty courtyards, this one is open to the street.

It is a very pleasant and relaxing hotel with water fountains, swimming pool and corridors in shadows. It also has a jacuzzi but you need to ask in advance for that. Sleeping beds were good.

The room was very spacious and clean.  The bathroom was modern and more than large enough. I only stayed for breakfast one morning, but it was everything that was promised.  Daniel was extremely open and friendly.  He gave my son (who lives in Antigua) and I a tour of his entire property and answered all the questions we had about Antigua, Guatemala, and Central America in general.  I attempted to make reservations for my wife and I later this month, but unfortunately Chez Daniel was already completely booked.  I will make arrangement well in advance next time.  I highly recommend  Chez Daniel",POS
50,"I stayed 4 nights at this hotel and everything was great. The staff was very effective and attentive, I was in contact before to book a taxi from the airport with a late check in and also had an early check out with no problem. The room was very comfortable with a great bed and good wifi as well as enough duvet as nights can be cold, no A/C needed really! The breakfast was good and I encourage you to take it from the second floor which has a fantastic views of the volcanoes.  The place is unique as it has a colonial style yet it is brand new, yet it is very well done with a lot of style. The walk to the centre of town is fast and pleasant as you see the real life walking through. It was also safe to walk back at night around 9pm. Highly recommended to relax in a pleasant place",POS

The bathroom was lovely, large and well-furnished. We ate at the restaurants 3 times, and really enjoyed the food.   My main criticism is that I felt that every time I turned around, there was a charge for something.  $2.75 for in-room coffee grounds.  About that for a (small) bottle of water.  $10 for internet. They had a very ample mini-bar and snacks, but prices were high. It did not make me feel well-cared-for.    Agree with other reviewers about women behind reception desk being quite cool.  However, the porters brought guests a refreshment (a juice of some kind).    Overall, I'd love to come back here, but I'll have",POS

If i had anything negative to say about this place, it would be that the walls are thin, so we could hear everything from our room all the time. We had to sleep with ear plugs in.  Also worth mentioning, they have the best airport shuttle in town located in their lobby (believe me, we looked around)!",POS

The owners did absolutely everything that they could to ensure an amazing stay.  Lucia made us a wonderful breakfast and dinner each day, and I highly recommend her tamales!  While the casa is a good distance from downtown Antigua, it is easy to reach by taxi, and Lucia was more than happy to drop us off and pick us up each day in the Parque Central in her own car, across from the Metropolitan Cathedral.  Lucia was also gracious enough to drive us to the market on market day with her friend Nancy, and we learned SO much about Guatemalan culture and cuisine.

It is a few blocks from the central area of town and convenient to walk to most everything. Professionally run business. Breakfast included each morning at 8.

We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant which is semi open air looking out over a courtyard.  Only a couple of issues: we were travelling with our teenage sons and had two rooms - normally I would have expected those rooms to be at least close to each other but in fact they were in different parts of the hotel.  In addition, the sound proofing between rooms is poor - we were woken on two consecutive nights by the nocturnal activities of our neighbours!  Also",POS

The reception staff is bilingual (Evi has a very good grasp of communicating and could work her way into other positions in international business environments.)  The staff did not know how to work the pumps and aeration system for the swimming pool and hot tub.  After two days, the water began turning green and slime was forming in the corners of the pool.  The pool/tub tiles need cleaning.  The hot tub did not have sufficient water levels and some of the parts should be replaced to",POS

Literally a 15-minute ride up the mountain and you find yourself on the mountainside surrounded by avocado trees, amazing gardens, and an awesome view of the volcanos and the valley below. It is especially stunning at sunrise and after dark, when the valley is filled with sparkling lights from the city. -The food is quite good overall; the vegetarian dinners are generally great. I even bought the cookbook on my first visit to recreate some of them at home. They are simple, fresh, and hearty. -I've stayed in the A-frames and the Cabana de la Tierra. The A-frames are rustic but the bed was comfortable and they did the job. I preferred",POS

Room 6 is very nice, but faces the street and can be noisy due to occasional vehicles.  Room 14 is good, but receives lots of early morning sunlight.  Try to stay in 11 or 12 at least one night.

Once you are dropped off at the end of the road at the village pila you take a 300 meter walk down a dirt path to the welcoming reception of the Earth Lodge staff. Please note that if you travel with wheelie luggage you may want to reconsider your bag selection.    The accommodations are excellent. We’ve tried them all: A-frame cabins in the tree canopy, a deluxe tree cabin with a tree growing right through it, the famous tree house, the dorm and camping spots. These are all available for a reasonable fee. They are comfortable, clean and quiet.  The Lodge is in a safe location and is very relaxing for singles couples and families. Don’t get me wrong",POS

Breakfast was AWESOME every morning.  We made plans to visit a coffee plantation and they had it all arranged for us.  The manager also helped us every night with our dinner reservations and recommended places to shop.  I will be staying there again in January 2008.

The location is great too, really close to the main plaza.  The highlight of this trip for me though was the tour to Acatenago that I booked through Tropicana. Much cheaper than any other place I saw online (350Q) but it was still a great time! Hostel provides all the gear, food and guides.

It is not a party hostel - it does have dorm rooms but I stayed in the private room with my daughter which is more like a luxury hotel suite with three beds, an ensuite bathroom and a private balcony with volcano view.  The staff are amazing - the price includes a delicious breakfast and everyone I met staying here didn't want to leave.

Later let us take our time waiting for bus, take a shower etc and didn't say anything about money for that. It's so kind and friendly! Moreover she prepares delicious breakfast too :) Guys who works there with her are also very nice. Mario helped a lot to my friend who had her phone broken, he took her to service and helped with translations etc. Amazing attitude of those Guys :) There is awesome famous(when you read opinions) tarrace with breath taking volcano view :) Don't look for anything else guys, just take it if it's still available :)",POS

40,"We only ended up staying one night here in a private room, due to a problem with the room which the hostel wanted to address straight away so they gave us a room at their sister hostel 10 minutes away. The room was nice but understood why they provided ear plugs as the private room was next to the road, cars speeding down the cobbled street plus church bells going off at random times in the early hours meant that we didn't sleep well at all. If we'd have stayed an extra night we definitely would have used the ear plugs!

The staff has a great mix of people with tremendous insight and knowledge about anything you need to make the best of a trip to Antigua.

They seem want to make the hostel a fun experience for any type of traveler.   LOCATION- Couldn't really be any better.

Wi-Fi didn´t have the beast reach and there is no T.V. inside rooms. If you are travelling with your car, there is only 1 space available, inside the house and during the night only. The street at night is really lonely so you might want to watch out and be on the look-out when you get in late. It is the kind of place you are looking for if you aren´t interested in something else other than just sleeping comfortably and safely, and taking a shower and feeling clean and fresh. It has the ideal",POS

The rooms were clean and well maintained, as well as decent cable with nice televisions.

The problem with the disgraceful service began before we even step our foot it the ""hotel"", as they charged my credit card (issued by european bank = got lousy exchange rate) without asking me while I wasnt there !!!!!

This is a hostel with one bathroom...one toilet and one shower in the same room. If someone is taking a 30-minute shower and you really need to pee, you're screwed. For some reason, even though the shower and toilet are together, the shower still reeks of piss. Also, they have birds that squawk incessantly through the afternoon, making it unbearable to hang around there.   My beef with them concerns the shuttle to San Salvador.

Everywhere there were antiquities on display. Candles lit the grounds at night. The furnishing scattered around the hotel all were worth looking at closely.

There are 2 ways to get to Parque Centrale but both will expose you to the endemic Chicken Bus fumes... another ""minus"" would be the cost of everything which is twice as much as almost everywhere else in Antigua... I guess that I would still consider the place if I brought children because of the pools and the security of a closed off resort.",NEG

Also the rooms and bathrooms are European-standard clean and comfortable, spacious and with good beds. But what will make this place one of the best addresses of our trip is the warm, spontaneous attitude of literally all of Casa Amarilla's staff.

The hotel once was a Convent and the arch was used by the nuns to cross the street in the 1600's.  Antigua was the capital of the western world during those times.

The rooms are modest sized, but extremely dark. The restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor dining. The food is good, but not outstanding. The issue that concerned us most was the hubbub of activity, particularly noticeable on weekends. The active street life (which we very much enjoyed) spilled into the hotel courtyard, which also serves as a favored locale for weddings and celebrations. Marimbas play from noon until five-ish, precluding the possibility of a siesta or reading in the courtyard.

The staff is very friendly and helpfull. They organized a tour to Pacaya and to a local coffee finca for us. But what made our stay really nice was the delicious breakfast that was served. Having breakfast on the rooftop with great views at all of the three volcanoes is a good start to the day. All in all the Yellow House is a very good option to stay in Antigua.,POS

I barley caught my flight. Also their WiFi is pretty bad, and your paying for it per night, but by the end of everything I wasn’t trying to argue over WiFi so I just let it go. Again, very nice spot.

The bed is comfortable, view in 201 is spectacular, breakfast is filling, wifi functions well (as I write this from my Posada bed!) shower/hot water works perfectly, the flat screen cable TV accesses 100 channels and, this place is just two blocks from the huge market.

It’s a great place from which to launch a walking circuit of all the sites in the city and is very close to a square where a (cooked) food market bustles at night. Plenty of tiendas for essentials like wine and snacks too.   As for the property, it is just lovely. Pass through a locked gate to a gorgeous small colonial courtyard with a small fountain.

The owner and her daughter were some of the most honest and genuine people I met on my trip. They helped me plan out most of my trip reserving shuttles and recommending different places to stay.

The service was impeccable, and the staff really did try to accommodate the guests. My only grouse was the $ 10 USD charge for internet, and the room charges for tea, water and coffee in the room.

The owner Luis was very helpful and we even had use of the kitchen.  Each room was like a museum, with ornate furniture and decorations.  The rooftop terrace gave us 360 degree views of Antigua.  This isn't a luxury hotel, it is wonderful and funky and we felt safe and comfortable here.",POS

30,"There were a series of courtyards upon entry that were nicely landscaped. In my wing (Rooms 101 - 108), there were french doors used to gain entry to my room.  I couldn't walk in with my suitcase or wearing a day pack.   I would have had to unlock the second door to step straight into the room.  This would mean re-bolting that same door to leave,  so I just turned sideways to come and go.  Certainly not the easiest way to enter and leave a room; pretty to look at though not particularly useful.  This wing was also on a busy side street that was noisy at night.  Because I was on a tour and our mornings came early, getting a good night's sleep was hard, even with ear plugs.   The hotel restaurant was open into the courtyard where my room was located and though it closed before 10",NEG

While slightly ""off the beaten path"" (a 10-15 minute walk to the Central Park), the hotel was quiet and peaceful, which we appreciated.  As two female travellers, we felt very safe walking to and from the hotel to the Center.    The staff was incredibly helpful in setting up tours and transport for us and were very kind, especially given our limited Spanish skills.    Breakfast (included with our room) was served every morning in a pretty courtyard that is very well maintained.

We stayed in the Green Room, which I was more excited by in person than from the photo on the website, for $125/night and it was very worth it.   The staff were very nice and very attentive.

After seeing all the rooms except one (Hortensias) in person I feel that our room - Orquideas - is the best room here. We were so wowed upon walking in for the first time. You have a large private courtyard as part of the room. You have to enter a locked door to get to it, so literally it is all yours and it's totally private and secure.

We were lucky enough to be bumped up to the suite (for no added cost) b/c all the other rooms were full. It is AMAZING. While it costs more money, it is definitely worth it.

Luckily we took out a lot of cash before we got there. Our bill was close to $600 and it ate up about half of our spending money right away. One of our rooms which was supposed to be a triple with 3 double beds was not as advertised. They threw a cot in the room as the third bed. The ceilings were taped up and the place was overall in need of a huge make over. Very run down. Very disappointed. And the worst part is a church bell rang every hour on the hour for 24 hours .

It appears they installed new windows which are more sound-proof.  We are going back to Antigua in December of 2006 and will definitely stay at the Hotel Aurora again.

We agreed to book on the understanding that we may cancel and travel somewhere else, but when we did they refused to return the $$...........a measly $75, and ignored emails asking for a refund after.

There aren't really other options for food around and no kitchen to use at the Earth Lodge so you depend on their pricy (but good!) restaurant.

Breakfast and lunch was too expensive and in my opinion falsely advertised when for example the ""HUGE bowl of yoghurt and granola"" barely was what I'd call big.

The mid-range price of 65 USD/night brought us a spacious triple room just a block off from Parque Central in the direction of the markets.  Lovely decor and aura aside, safety is a bit of a concern here.  The concierge is located behind the curvy staircase and we found it not to be always manned.

It was a little odd in the afternoons as loud music was blaring but there was absolutely no one eating or drinking in the courtyard. I think if the owner focussed on making it slightly above backpackers at the late 20s, early 30s crowd I think it would be awesome.

Fernando was my porter.  He is kind and patient, staying back with me on the descent through the farmlands (which I personally found to be more challenging than the upwards climb).

The mercado is really close, so it's perfect to go get fresh food, and there is also a grocery store in te same area. It is well located at about 8-10 minutes walk from the central park. But what makes it great is the owner Tanya: she's very devoted, very helpful and ultra friendly. For the new years eve, she cooked a real amazing feast for everyone, it was pretty amazing.

The only improvement I feel the hotel could use is a little grocery shop that carries snacks, pops, etc. But there is two little shops across the street that sell a few groceries.

We loved the beautiful courtyard, grassy lawn, garden, and indoor/outdoor living spaces.  The kitchen was excellent and the proximity to the central market made it easy for us to cook for ourselves (with consequent cost savings).  The hosts and cleaning/maintenance folks were wonderful, very warm and kind, and provided all the information and assistance that we needed to get acquainted with the region.  We walked everywhere in town, and appreciated the quiet street the Apartamentos are on, compared to many of the more trafficky and noisy areas.

Long story short, he arranged for us to stay at another hotel at a moment's notice, and considering  it was the flower festival and most of Antigua was booked out - this, to me, was like pulling a rabbit out of a hat.  The attitude and friendliness to get us sorted so quickly was one you would not normally come across.  So thank you Gustova for your amazing help.  We then spent two night s at Hotel Y Arte.

There was a rooster next door that liked to make noise at all hours of the night, but nothing horrible.  Noisy on the weekends but I would assume that it is like that way at many places downtown.

My room was lovely, with comfortable bed, chair, desk, nice amenities in the bathroom, and TV with many channels (though mostly in Spanish).

Note, however, that there is no ""restaurant"" per se; just a kitchen for the staff to prepare breakfast.  Needless to say, if you're sick or it's raining or you simply want a coffee or other beverage or snack, you'll have to walk about 10 minutes.

There is some street noise due to a couple of social clubs in the neighborhood but my experience after a two eweek stay was that the parties usually end by 10pm.   Rooms on the upper floor are lighter due to the open view but noisier too. Rooms on the first floor are generally quieter but dark due to the fact that they are enclosed by the very small terrace area.

Hands down some of the best hostel food I've had. The hostel itself is pretty isolated, so don't come here if you're looking for lots of options at night.

Nevertheless, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and kept the reservation. The grounds are beautiful and room has tasteful design, however the staff were not the most welcoming.

Service was also excellent; each guest is greeted at the door each time you enter. We also enjoyed a drink in the lovely bar and ate breakfast each day in the restaurant.

We were in the cheap rooms downstairs which either had no windows, or a window facing into a dark corridor. At $27 a night they were a good deal for a couple wanting a clean and safe place to crash at night.  If you're a backpacker wanted to meet people however, this is not the place for you.

Another problem is the non existing AC, and therefore it is always kind of hot in your room with no cool air from the outside, as you have to keep your window closed because of the noise... To conclude, although that hotel is not of course the worst ever, far from it, it certainly is not the one you want to spend several nights at. There are more and",NEG

The first problem we encounter was with parking, if you are renting a car or are taking your car to Antigua it would be an inconvenience to stay at this hotel. First of all, they can only give you a parking spot (that is one block from the hotel) but starting at 6:30pm so if you arrive early in the day prepare to find somewhere else to leave your car. Then they told us that we had to take it out from the parking lot early in the morning (7:30am), so sorry if you plan to rest and wake up a little later. I asked if they knew any other place I could leave my car, the first person told me they found one but it would cost me Q150 ($20, that is outrageous) and the next one told me they didn't",NEG

We found ourselves 'trapped' in Antigua during the recent volcanic activity and Tropical Storm Agatha, and wound up spending several nights at the Panaza Verde.  The front desk help were incredibly helpful, friendly, and quick to get us through our emergency.

The location is perfect- right across from Iglesia Merced which is where all the main processions start and end during Holy Week, and he only charged us $90 a night, which is expensive for Guatemala but NOT for Holy Week.

I realize it’s not their holiday, but so many Americans were there that week, and hotels serve it all over the world.

It is good value for money and I would recommend this place to anyone for a traditional Antigua house to stay in. ",POS

10,世界遺産の町、アンティグア・グアテマラは、スペイン語学校が多いことでも有名。世界中からのバックパッカーで賑わっている。こちらのホテルは「エコノミーホテル」としてLonely Planetで紹介されていることもあり、バックパッカーの間では有名。私も長期滞在のつもりでチェックインしたのだが、シングルルームは暗くて清潔感に乏しく、さらに悪いことにトイレの排水口からひどい臭いがして安眠できず、翌日には早々にチェックアウトした。運が悪かっただけなのかもしれないが、2度と泊まらないと思う。,NEG

There is a bar on roof top where u can have a drink at night and watch volcano at day time. Nothing I can complain given the money I paid. Definitely recommend to go if u need a cheap and clean place to stay in antigua.   Note: if u arrive antigua by bus and would like to try the interesting tuk tuk car to get to this hostel from bus terminal, don't over pay the driver.

The staff are superb and welcome you in like a friend and go above and beyond to make your stay comforting, continually going out of their way to please you. Cool bar staff, costume dress ups to liven the place, great food (don't skip on the Sunday Special), clean, movie room, spacious doors, and does get quiet after 10/1030pm.

We loved the location, too, since it was just one block from the action, so an easy, safe evening walk to good restaurants, yet very quiet.

Here are the negatives lighting in room was very dim and we really needed two bedside lights and as other reviewers have commented there is no hot water at best it was tepid.

It costed $59 USD which doesn't come easily to a backpacker. I know they have rules, but they need to allow a small level of human error or unforseen circumstances.

The breakfast was minimal (toast, fruit, coffee).  The staff speak enough English to get you checked in/out.

30,"We were there for two days in July 2016 with a group of 14 people. The hotel has recently gone through a facelift and all the rooms are very nice. However, there is only once source of ventilation--windows that open onto the interior courtyard. That means no cross ventilation. The weather was rather humid for Antigua and even with windows and the door open, the air in the room was dead and uncomfortably warm and humid. One room (204 I believe) had a distinct smell of mold. The occupants filched a fan from the hallway but it didn't help much. We were able to get the one and only other fan from the front desk and it regenerated the air in the room nicely. One thing we don't like though is that you do have to keep the windows open to get any air in the room -- a security hazard.",NEG

A tip for booking your room:  do it on line as there are more specials available that they don't offer if you call.  Also read the fine print as to what exactly you are requesting. We ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast one morning-the buffet was really outstanding; ordered lunch by the awesome pool-food wasn't so great but the cervezas made up for it; had drinks in the bar-excellent; dessert on the last night- outstanding!

As others have mentioned, the walls aren’t especially thick, so one night I heard the conversation of people coming home next door at 2am and another night had hours of a baby crying next door (not that that can be helped, just the fact that the walls are thin).

All rooms are ""on the street.""  The sound of the traffic can keep you awake, or awaken you, so we asked for a rotating, floor fan (one of 3 the hotel has) and closed the window and the shutters.

We were ok until the bad concert lasted until 1 am. At 1 am I had to ask the watchman to call the police, be aware that at 6:00 pm the manager leaves, they close the door and there is nobody to assist you.

It had no fan or really any way to ventilate the room which was a downside, and I'm not sure how you would heat it during the cooler nights.   Breakfast up on the roof was always a relaxing way to start the day.  The selling points for this hotel are its location and the amazing staff.

This hotel has just six rooms available, which is perfect if you are in the search for a romantic and quiet place. At night they light candles in the garden but our bad luck was to catch a rainy weekend. The rooms are clean and cozy; it has a mini bar, small TV, towels, bathrobe and sandals, even a sewing kit. Our room had a balcony but because of the rainy days we couldn`t use it. On a nice day it would be ideal to have a conversation with your couple, maybe some wine or even just sit and enjoy the outdoors.

It is a small lovingly built Bed and Breakfast in what we would say is the best neighborhood in all of Antigua. Just a few streets away we found art galleries, craftsman stores and antique shops..all worth visiting. We stayed in a the suite at the top of the stairs, which had a lovely spa in the bathroom, a happy place for us to unwind after a day of sightseeing. Carla and Beatriz were so lovely to us, arranging for a taxi and preparing our wonderful breakfasts. Without question this is the Hotel we'd stay at on our next visit to Antigua and Guatemala......",POS

The private, flower-drenched courtyards, the elegant rooms, the romantic fireplaces all made for the most wonderful ambiance.  The staff were truly gracious, and anticipated our every need, including rose petals strewn throughout our bathroom and patio.  The restaurant, Las Mil Flores, was fantastic.

After filling up 4 passports on 6 Continents, I have to say that I adore this hotel more than any other hotel I have ever stayed in.  Just look at the ""traveler rating"" and you will see the LION'S SHARE of the reviews are ""EXCELLENT"" and also only 2 ""terribles"".

Best cleaning job I've seen anywhere.  My only criticism is that because of the layout there's no common area for guests and this often resulted in noisy conversations happening right outside our room. One morning there was a big tour group who were really loud and woke us before 7am.

The desk staff was not very warm, although the cleaning and maintenance staff was nice.  We had a small group with three rooms, so saw the variety.  Our room was clean, but the paint on the wall facing the courtyard was stained (with mold, perhaps), and gave the impression of lack of maintenance.  The bathroom door was old and beautiful (lots of patina), but did not fit the opening, so there was a 10"" gap between the bottom of the door and the floor, which seemed haphazard.  The lights in the room were extremely dim and led to a dreary experience.  The hot water in the shower was fine, and there were no problems.",NEG

Our bathroom had a leak and the staff were great at fixing it right away. Our bedroom was right next to the street so that made it pretty difficult for us to rest because of the cars and sound.

It's a really calm hotel which I enjoyed since I hate to hear young kids running around all the time. There was, however, a wedding, but who can get mad at that :)",POS
50,Hotel was selected as part of a nice Caravan escorted tour of Guatemala and it was a treat.  The rooms have a nice Colonial feel to them and we really enjoyed the ambiance.  Good customer service by all staff.,POS
50,"The  first thing that strikes you as you walk in is the green garden oasis, flowering native orchids and rich sense of taste.  After escorted by the best of service to your room we enjoyed a world-class meal at the restaurant.  So close to the main plaza of Antigua, you can walk everywhere, feel safe and REST once you arrive.  I particularly liked the petite spa/swimming pool in the back, private area.  Tastefully decorated with colonial art and never overdone.....DONA LEONOR BOUTIQUE HOTEL should be first on your list.",POS
10,"Was recommended this hostel and was very disappointed. Toilets weren’t clean, dorms were packed and very little room to move (and to leave bags/valuables). Acatenango tour very expensive and better elsewhere, just shop around and see for yourself. On the plus side rooms are quiet at night and guests were considerate of others.",NEG
50,This little 7 bedroom hotel is safe and secure within a gated area. It is relaxing and tranquil with couches on the terraces and communal areas. There is not a huge choice for breakfast but with the surroundings and eating poolside you tend not to notice. Rooms are huge with plenty of drawers and hanging space. There is a roof terrace so in the evening you can sit up there with a bottle of wine and a fantastic view of the volcanoes.,POS

We had meetings here, and took all our meals in the restaurant. The breakfast was OK, but not inspiring. Lunch and dinner were much more interesting and well-prepared, with different specialties each meal. It's at least a 20 minute walk into town, but our group was happy for the exercise.",POS
40,"Though lacked a character, the small room was comfortable and clean enough. The shower was really hot and strong, which I liked it most. Wifi was availalbe in the room and very fast.

The price was 150Q for Friday and Saturday regardless of double or single, while 110Q(1 pax) and 140(2 pax) on Sunday thru Thursday.",POS

This place delivers!  The cost was very reasonable, and breakfast was only $5 (though i chose to eat out instead)  I imagine that some would have complained about the cleanliness of the room, but for me, I was mainly looking for somewhere close to town, quiet, and safe, so the lack of the 5* amenities and feel to the rooms was fine for me.  If you, however, are a really picky person, you may want to spend more to stay at a higher level boutique hotel.",POS

We did not drive, but I did see parking about 2 blocks (maximum) away from the hotel. Hotel itself is very small and quaint. We had two rooms (2 adults and 3 teens/pre-teens). One was the Master room which had a nice little patio on the roof that you accessed via a window. Room had an incredibly comfortable king bed, was very clean and was plenty big enough for the two of us.

30,"I stayed 2 nights in this hotel in January 2010.  The hotel is nice in a colonial house.  The staff is friendly and helpful (questions for bus reservation and tours).  The room was very clean and well furnished.  But there are many drawbacks.  There is no wifi ! Only one computer with internet is available at the reception but only from 8.00 am to 8.00 pm !!! They do not accept credit cards only cash ! There is no laundry service but there is a laundry 50 meters away... The room was quite dark and noisy for two reasons : there are seats in the corridor so  you can hear people talking when they seat and you can even hear the shower of you neighboors in the hotel. The location is not bad, but few blocks closer from the center would have been better.  No breakfast available only",NEG

40,We went for dinner and it was quite tasty. The presentation was nice too. The kids meal was nice and small. Pasta was tasty and so were the fries. Great homemade chips. They have live music playing after 7 but we came before and they were not very busy. A lovely atmosphere. ,POS

Our room (room 6) was immaculately clean.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was surprisingly spacious.  The room itself wasn't huge, but it felt a lot bigger than I think it actually was.  A small television with a number of English language channels was included.  The location on the 2nd floor gave us great views of a few of the volcanoes.

Breakfast is free, at the cafe next door.  Breakfast was very good.  Hotel is not as centrally located as some, but that means you don't have other people around all the time.

Views up there are 360 degrees and fantastic.",POS
40,"Great architecture and decoration. Location is excellent, a 5 minute walk from the Central Plaza, next door to a top level restaurant, and yet far away from all the noise.

30,"This hotel is ideally situated in Antigua. The hotel has a nice garden and roof top terrace. The rooms (ours was number 2) was decorated ok, good bedding, totally obscure when the shutters were closed. A 24hour coffee pot was useful for those early starts to the volcano climbs.  There is one massive drawback that would stop us staying here again. The giveaway is that around all the walls are signs stating please be quiet, people are resting. When you are in your room you can not only hear what people are saying at the front desk, or in the garden but worse you can hear every word of room 1 (in our case). Really annoying when your jetlagged and want some sleep.   Maybe other rooms are better?",NEG

It is a shame the music that plays all day is basically the same playlist I had on my ipod in 2006.   3/5 is a bit unfair, really it's a 3.5/5 but when you are in bed hungover and you get woken up by Limp Bizkit...

They also offer breakfast for a small price. Tea and coffee are always available for free.

The staff were friendly and responsive, and concerned about making sure that we had everything we needed. It is a few blocks farther away from shops and restaurants than other hotels are, but it's more accessible to the main road - the parking garage is right by the entrance to Antigua, which minimizes the amount of driving you have to do over uncomfortable cobblestones.",POS

All the rooms are around a courtyard garden and as the first room we were shown was rather small and dark, I asked if we could change rooms and was given a larger room with more windows letting in more light from the courtyard, in which we were very comfortable.  Breakfast which is included in the price was plentiful with a very varied choice.

I certainly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a quiet haven in Antigua.",POS

It was the cleanest hostel I have stayed in whilst travelling Central America, they offer private and dormitory accommodation. I stayed in a dorm room with a very comfortable bed, clean sheets, good lighting and good under-bed cage lockers. A restaurant with good food choice and a seating area. Lounge and tv area are a nice spot to hang out. A bar with a good range of drinks, this isn't the same extent of party hostel as Nicaragua, the party moves from the hostel to the local bars at a reasonable hour so you are still granted with a good nights rest on the nice beds.

What else? I advise you to choose this hotel because it is right at the main square, near at a big supermarket and the market as well as the all monuments. You can eat your breakfast on the rooftop where there is a marvellous view of the Agua Volcano. Staff helps organise tours, trips.

The owner of the hotel made sure by calling the company that it was the right tour company not a random company who would then double charge us.   On another day we were taking the 6.00 am tour to Pacaya volcano. Breakfast does not get served until 7.30.

The hotel is a renovated colonial house with two amazing courtyards and incredibly well decorated with well kept antiques and nice paintings. It has several terraces with breathtaking views of the volcanos. I stayed in room 21 which was very spacious, specially the bathroom that has a huge jacuzzi and a walk-in shower.

We stayed in a dorm, and I LOVED the individual curtains around each bunk! This is something I wish every hostel did. Bathrooms and spaces were cleaned often and this was a great place to stay. My one complaint is that one of the locker units in our dorm did not have a back and was not connected to the wall, so if it was tilted forward someone could grab anything inside. So I recommend checking your lockers for this:) But all in all, I would stay here again.",POS

Notes:  There is a 300m descent into this lodge from where you will be dropped off.  If possible make sure you have a backpack.  Otherwise it's going to be a bit rough (although very doable...it's what I did).  On that same note this is at altitude.  That 300m climb is much rougher when you're not used to the altitude.

40,"If I had one piece of advice when choosing which hostel to stay in Antigua it would be to choose a hostel with a terrace. Due to being a town surrounded by multiple volcanos, it's pretty nice to have an area like the Terrace has to offer where you can chill, eat and drink with a view of Antigua. The Terrace offers transport and activities at the best price you will come across which really added to the stay. Our budget room itself didn't have a fan which we probably would have not chose if we're informed of this - however I'm sure the pricier private room wouldn't have had this problem. ",POS

Economico e anche molto, essenziale e semplice anche troppo, è il punto di ritrovo dei backpacker di Antigua.

10,"We stayed only one night in Selina Antigua but it was enough to figure out that everything there looks good in appearance, but that the whole place is overall in a bad shape. First evening without warm water - the staff decided to keep us waiting more than 1 hour rather than switching us to another room (which shouldn’t have been that complicated considering the fact that the hostel was pretty empty on that day of December). Same scenario in the morning - no warm water and we had to go to the reception and wait again for someone to come and fix it. After a while, we realized that our double-room was located in a wing of the building where we were probably the only guests on that night and that nobody really seemed to care about us. Speaking about this wing of the building, pro",NEG
50,"I just love Guatemala. My first trip there was in 1973!  Back then It was love at first sight. Now, I try to go twice a year. This time I decided to change my regular accommodation and I found this cozy place, ""Serendipity"",  which honors the word's meaning: Serendipity means a ""fortunate happenstance"" or ""pleasant surprise"". It was coined by Horace Walpole in 1754. (Wikipedia)  I stayed 10 days, did not want to leave, but I am sure this will be my home away from home. Everything is magical and Antiguas soul is in this superb home.   My best regards and congratulations to all the nice people who make this place so special! Thanks for the best holiday ever. You will see me there very soon Bu this time I plan to stay at least three weeks!  Leonor Betanzos Ángeles  Mexico City  ",POS

The idea is great because they offer good quality stay for good value but additionally they have spaces to work, beatufiul green garden they have nice bar with live music. The building itself is a piece of colonial architecture. We stayed there for 1 night only but we enjoyed it very much. Double room we stayed in was rather small but had everything we needed - very comfy bed, hot shower and some space for our luggage. In the room but also in the whole place you will find a lot of nice artistic/design touches. The location is the best. You go outside and you are in the center of the town. Lots of restaurants, bars and places to see. I highly recommend this place.",POS

The location of the hotel wasn't truly centrally - it was a few blocks from the main drags. The trade off for walking a few extra blocks though was a nice and peaceful location.  The room itself was very spacious - big bathroom, two full beds, a sitting area, TV (with cable channels, many in English - a nice find after a period of travel in small villages with no news!). They provide bottled water every day (very nice!), but there were not basic items like tissues or a shower cap in the room.

My first nervous emails on booking trips and my stay here were answered super fast with a lot of patience. Upon my arrival I planned to stay for 2 nights. Due to different circumstances I missed my shuttle to my next destination. They didn't only pay for my next shuttle (it wasn't even completely their fault) but they also too care of my extra nights and worked hard to look for the best alternative.

The place was clean and the beds comfortable.  There are a group of hotels that allow you to use a pool at another location. That was a nice feature so we could spend a hot afternoon at a pool.  The breakfast was great as well.,POS
40,This nicely presented hotel is down a little alley way in this lovely town. It has a tiny court yard with flowers and sunny terrace upstairs which has a view of the volcano. The breakfast and sigh are free and the only Spanish speak staff are delightful. I think they are missing a trick and should serve breakfast on the terrace. I was the only guest and the staff decided to chat in the kitchen which was opposite my room every morning -go to the reception desk away from your guests!  Also Room tip be upstairs away from the Kitchen noise. Good people and sweet enough ,POS

My wife and I stayed for four nights. Four out of three nights, I could hear person next room snoring. Wall doesn't have much insulation. Breakfast was coffee and piece of bread.

After a relaxing dip in the pool and a reasonably priced massage in the Thai Garden you are conveniently near a dozen cool restaurants. Food at the hotel is main stream and the price is right. Rooms are stuffy in the day but cool by bed time.",POS
50,This place has a great six bed dorm room (no bunks) and gets a good mix of travellers - sociable but not party scene. The breakfast is abundant and delicious and they have a tour agency on site so I had no problem fixing up activities at short notice. It's also kept very clean.  Minor criticisms are the kitchen is very small so not very geared up to travellers who want to cook their own meals. There's also probably not quite enough shared bathrooms so sometimes there is an occasional wait for the shower. There is no lock on the dorm room but they always had someone on the front desk and there are lockers in the room for valuables.  I was very happy with this hostel.,POS

The hostel is at a good location, has a nice shower and the dorms are fine. The beds aren't the best ones I had in Guatemala but they are good enough to let you sleep.

The view from the cabins and the restaurant are wonderful. So why no 5 stars? Because there are 2 things we didn't like: 1) the hotel is a few hundred meters downhill from the road. And I really mean downhill. So it takes you just a few minutes to walk down to the lodge, but much more to get back to the road again. You have to carry your own luggage, the hotel charges a high fee to do it for you. It would be hospitable if someone from the Earth Lodge helps with the transport of the luggage to the hotel. 2) There is a parking area at the end of the road to the earthlodge.

There is a rooftop terrace in the hotel where you can see the volcanoes and the rooftops of Antigua. The staff was very kind and helpful. Free coffee, tea and water.

The manager would talk loudly asking who the ""idi*t"" in the shower was, and also talk patronizingly to the girl in the showers friend. He banged the door to the shower and screamed at the girl in the shower, terrible behaviour and not a way that you should treat your customers in. Get the shower fixed instead!
